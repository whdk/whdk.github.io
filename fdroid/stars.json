Journals and Notes are compliant to the definition of the VJOURNAL component, Tasks are compliant to the VTODO component. Future features will also include import and export functionalities to and from .ics files :-)\n\n<b>Combine journals, notes & tasks</b>\nInstead of using separate apps for journals, notes & tasks you can use them out of one hand, combine and link them to each other, e.g. create meeting minutes and link your tasks to them.\n\n<b>Sync with DAVx5 (coming soon)</b>\nSynchronize your entries with any compatible CalDAV server by using DAVx5. By using DAVx5 you are free to choose your preferred provider for CalDAV, you can even use your local server to store and synchronize your data.\nNote: DAVx5 is an independent app and must be acquired separately.\n\n<b>Open Source</b>\nYour data can contain private and sensitive data by their nature. We believe that individuals and companies should be able to be in full control of their own data. This means the freedom to choose where and how the data are stored, and freedom in choice of software. That is why we chose DAVx5 as a Sync Adapter to synchronise your data between your phone and any compatible CalDAV-server. The source code for jtx Board is publically available - find out more on https://jtx.techbee.at !\n\n<i>What does VJournal and VTodo mean?</i>\nVJournal and VTodo are calendar components defined in the international standard RFC-5545, the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar), see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545 . This standard also defines the VEvent component, which is the standard definition for calendar event entries. jtx Board is using the VJournal component according to this iCalendar standard for journal entries and tasks. VJournals can have a defined start date, but they cannot have a duration or an end date. VJournals with a defined start date are considered journals entries in jtx Board, VJournals without start date are interpreted as notes. The VTodo component as defined in the iCalendar standard defines the technical specification of tasks, which can have a scheduled start, due and completed date as well as a progress and a completed status (amongst others).\n\nThe VEvent definition is widely used, the VTodo component also found some implementations in Apps, but the VJournal component remained in the dark almost not being implemented at all by other apps and services. With jtx Board we would like to revive the usage of this standard and empower it with the possibilities to link and combine VTodos with VJournals - and in the future also VEvents! :-)\n\nFind out more on <a href=\"https://jtx.techbee.at\" target=\"_blank\">https://jtx.techbee.at</a>",

We do not employ KYC/AML, nor do we ever plan on doing so.\n\n- Trusted by the Community\nOur platform has operated for over four years, survived the Great Cryptocurrency Market Crash of 2018, and through its community-oriented diligent service became one of the most trusted names in the extremely skeptical Monero community.\n\n- Secure, Open Source, Privacy-Centric, Censorship-Resistant\nOur app is free and open source, which ensures that many eyes are looking at the app's code to ensure that there are no security holes or privacy leaks. Open sourcing our app also allows anyone to have access to our app even if a certain app repository censors the app. Our app even works on phones that have Google completely blocked. We value your privacy so much, we don’t even require you to provide an email when registering.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss\nIssue tracker: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss/issues\n\n- Stellar Support\nOur support team is fast, responsive and always eager to please.

Saber is the ultimate handwritten notetaking app designed to elevate your note-taking experience to new heights! Embrace the art of handwriting and unleash your creativity with this feature-rich application, powered by cutting-edge technologies. Saber's intuitive and modern interface makes it effortless to jot down notes, draw diagrams, or annotate PDFs with precision.\n\nAs I was beginning to make digital notes, I couldn't find any private open-source apps that fit my requirements so I ended up having to use a proprietary app. I decided to create Saber to give people a choice of a private open-source app that they can trust. Saber is completely open-source, meaning that anyone can audit the code to ensure that it is secure and private. Saber encrypts your data and can sync to any compatible server of your choice, giving you complete control over your data.\n\nDo you like to make notes on a tablet then transfer them to your computer? Or perhaps you prefer to type your notes on a laptop and then annotate them on a tablet? Whatever your workflow, Saber has you covered with its multi-platform support, allowing you to access your notes anytime, anywhere, on any device. Saber is available on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux, with your notes automatically synchronized across all your devices. And if you're offline, Saber will automatically sync your notes when you're back online.\n\nSaber features the best digital highlighter you've ever used. Have you ever needed to highlight multiple lines but hated the way the highlighter would overlap and change color? Saber utilizes advanced graphics processing to handle overlaps and maintain pen color consistency, giving you a highlighter experience better than traditional paper.\n\nSaber has everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders inside folders to your heart's content with no limit on the number of nested folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder, you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available on the home screen.\n\nSaber can intelligently invert your notes when you're in dark mode. This means that you can experience the entire note-taking experience in dark mode, including your images, for a soothing and cohesive interface in low-light environments.\n\nDiscover a whole new way to capture and organize your thoughts with Saber. Whether you're a student, professional, or creative mind, Saber is your trusted companion for digital handwriting. Download now and let your ideas flow freely!\n",

You must procure a ship (6), a captain (5), and a crew (4), the\nremainder is your cargo.\n\nOnce you have your ship, captain, and crew, you can click on dice that you wish\nto hold in order to save them rather than roll them. You can also choose to keep\nthem all if the conditions are right. The \"point\" or high score is always\nvisible, and that is a big help to the \"hammer\" or the last player.\n\nThis game is open source and add free! So grab a couple friends and set sail for\nhigh adventure with this fun little dice game. If your lucky, you may even\nstrike \"midnight\"!",

    "description": "Communicate securely and independent, regardless of the legal situation or whether messengers use E2EE. No server needed. #ChatKontrolleStoppen\n\n<b>Why KryptEY?</b>\nBreaking of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by laws such as the planned EU chat control is an ongoing issue. Content in messengers that use E2EE, such as Whatsapp or Signal, could thus be monitored by third parties. E2EE is often, but not always, standard in messengers. There are proven methods for E2EE such as PGP. However, these methods are sometimes cumbersomely integrated and require a lot of effort to use.\n\nKryptEY is an Android keyboard that implements the Signal protocol. The keyboard works messenger-independently and both the X3DH Key Agreement Protocol and the Double Ratchet Algorithm work without a server, thus it enables a highly independent use of the protocol.\n\n<b>Features</b>\nBased upon Simple Keyboard ( https://github.com/rkkr/simple-keyboard ), KryptEY adds a view above the Keyboard for the E2EE functionality.\n\n* use E2EE through Signal Protocol in any messenger\n* encryption/decryption of messages\n* enter message through separate text field in keyboard\n* use clipboard to read messages\n* manage contacts in own contact list in keyboard\n* message log to view sent/received messages\n* send messages as plain JSON (raw mode) or hidden in a decoy text (fairytale mode)\n* verification of E2EE functionality via fingerprint\n* Q&A View for questions\n* dark & light theme\n\nSee https://github.com/amnesica/KryptEY/blob/master/KRYPTEY.md for further information on how KryptEY is working.\n\n<b>Security</b>\nThe existing security properties for the Signal Protocol are also valid for the keyboard.\n\n<b>Limitations</b>\nThe keyboard was designed as a POC and only allows 1-to-1 conversations. However, the application can also be used in a group chat to a limited extent. Here, a message can be directed to a specific chat partner and not to all people. Other participants of the group chat cannot decrypt the message.\n\nText messages in Telegram are getting copied as HTML and not as plain text. When decoding the message with the fairytale mode the copied message is compromised and can't be read properly. Therefore, it can't be decoded at all. However, the raw mode works properly. When using KryptEY with Telegram we recommend the raw mode.\n\nSome messengers like Threema only allows up to 3500 bytes per message. Therefore, different character input limitations apply. To stay under the 3500 bytes limit, only 500 characters are allowed for raw and fairytale mode. For convenience these limitation applies for all messengers.\n\n<b>Demo</b>\nFor a demonstration on how KryptEY is used see https://github.com/amnesica/KryptEY/tree/master#demo \n\nKryptEY was created by mellitopia and amnesica. The code is open source and can be found at https://github.com/amnesica/KryptEY\n",

No more mental math before bed - after a single button press, your head can hit the pillow and you will <i>warp</i> forwards in time with minimal interruption.\n\n<b>How to use</b>\n\nWhen you open Warpclock for the first time, you should configure your preferred amount of sleep using the in-app controls. There are buttons to increase and decrease the amount by 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 1 minute. You only need to set this once.\n\nThere is also a button labeled \"Set alarm\" inside the app. Pressing this button will create a new one-shot alarm in your default alarm clock app, configured to wake you up after your personalized amount of time has passed. The alarm will automatically delete itself from your alarm app once it has triggered, keeping your list of saved alarms clean.\n\nOnce the alarm is created, you'll get two toast notifications. The first notification is from Warpclock, displaying the time that the new alarm should go off. The second notification comes from the system alarm clock, confirming that it was created sucessfully and displaying how far in the future the alarm will occur.\n\n\nThe app also exposes a widget that you can add to your homescreen for even faster access.\n\nIn the default launcher, just long-press on your homescreen background and drag the \"Warpclock\" widget to a location on your homescreen, and drag the edges to resize as desired. Tapping on the widget text will create a new alarm just as if you'd pressed the \"Set alarm\" button in the app. You'll get the same two toast notifications as well.\n\n\nThe alarm is created in your default alarm clock app, so you should use that to configure the default alarm sound and vibration settings. Once an alarm is created, if the trigger time needs to be adjusted, that should also be done in the default alarm clock app.\n\n<b>Current limitations</b>\nThis app currently does not handle Daylight Savings Time changes, it simply adds the configured amount and rolls over at 24 hours. You'll need to manually fix a couple of alarms per year if you live in a region that still changes the time back and forth.\n",

    "description": "Contact Diary is a simple app that allows you to keep a record of the people you have met and the events you have attended to recently. In the undesired event that you test positive for COVID-19, Contact Diary is a place where to quickly find who you must warn about the situation.\n\n<b>How it works</b>\nEvery day Contact Diary will prompt you to insert the events you have attended and the people you have been with during the day. Through some simple forms you will be able to store the essential information about your contacts, in case you need to retrieve it. Just that. Simple, right? ;)\n\n<b>Features</b>\n<ul>\n<li> Configurable notification time, so the prompt does not interfere with your daily workflow.</li>\n<li> Show only potentially risky contacts.</li>\n<li> Automatic removal of entries older than 15 days.</li>\n<li> Export your latest contacts to a CSV file that you can share with the authorities.</li>\n<li> JUST ONE PERMISSION, that needed for the app being able to notify you after device restarts. Nothing else.</li>\n<li> In particular, NO INTERNET permission. The information entered is yours, and it never leaves your device.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>FAQ</b>\n- Wait, isn't this what Governments' contact tracing apps are doing?\nNo. The goals of Governments' contact tracing apps and of Contact Diary are inherently different. Governments' contact tracing apps <em>notify you</em> when you have been at risk, and Contact Diary serves to remember who <em>you must notify</em> if you test positive.\n\n- Is this app BETTER than Governments' contact tracing apps?\nNo. Governments' contact tracing apps may account for contacts that you may not be aware of, like the person sitting in a neighboring table at a restaurant, or that other person using the same bus to go to work. Contact Diary IS NOT A REPLACEMENT TO GOVERNMENTS' CONTACT TRACING APPS.\n\n- Is this app WORSE than Governments' contact tracing apps?\nNo. Government's contact tracing apps crucially rely on all persons interacting to have the app in order to do proper notifications. With Contact Diary, you just need yourself to keep track, and you can easily notify people (or places) that do not use conventional contact tracing apps.\n\n- Will this app share the information I input?\nNO. The app has no permissions, so there is no way that it can connect to the internet. The information you insert will never leave your device. Even more, entries in the diary are automatically eliminated when they become older than 15 days.\n\n<b>Support</b>\nIf you find a bug, have an idea on how to improve Contact Diary or have a question, please visit the Contact Diary project page on GitHub: https://github.com/apozas/contactdiary\n",

Fortunately, you can also enable biometric unlock if your device has a biometrics sensor (i.e. fingerprint or face unlock).\n\n<b>Organization</b>\nOver time, you'll likely accumulate tens of entries in your vault. Aegis Authenticator has lots of organization options to make finding the one you need at a particular moment easier. Set a custom icon for an entry to make it easier to find. Search by account name or service name. Have a lot of one-time passwords? Add them to custom groups for easier access. Personal, Work and Social can each get their own group.\n\n<b>Backups</b>\nTo make sure you will never lose access to your online accounts, Aegis Authenticator can create automatic backups of the vault to a location of your choosing. If your cloud provider supports the Storage Access Framework of Android (like Nextcloud does), it can even create automatic backups to the cloud. Creating manual exports of the vault is also supported.\n\n<b>Making the switch</b>\nTo make the switch easier, Aegis Authenticator can import the entries of lots of other authenticators, including: 2FAS Authenticator, Authenticator Plus, Authy, andOTP, FreeOTP, FreeOTP+, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Steam, TOTP Authenticator and WinAuth (root access is required for the apps that don't have an option to export).\n\n<b>Feature overview</b>\n<ul><li>Free and open source</li><li>Secure<ul><li>Encrypted, can be unlocked with a password or biometrics</li><li>Screen capture prevention</li><li>Tap to reveal</li></ul></li><li>Compatible with Google Authenticator</li><li>Supports industry standard algorithms: HOTP and TOTP</li><li>Lots of ways to add new entries<ul><li>Scan a QR code or an image of one</li><li>Enter details manually</li><li>Import from other popular authenticator apps</li></ul></li><li>Organization<ul><li>Alphabetic/custom sorting</li><li>Custom or automatically generated icons</li><li>Group entries together</li><li>Advanced entry editing</li><li>Search by name/issuer</li></ul></li><li>Material design with multiple themes: Light, Dark, AMOLED</li><li>Export (plaintext or encrypted)</li><li>Automatic backups of the vault to a location of your choosing</li></ul>\n\n<b>Open source and license</b>\nAegis Authenticator is open source (licensed under GPL v3) and the source code can be found here: http://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis\n",

    "description": "Fertility Test Analyzer is the best fertility app to help you interpret both pregnancy and ovulation test strips by giving you the % of pigmentation. It provides you with fertility charts based on your hormone levels so you can pinpoint your fertile window and track your early pregnancy days. Fertility Test Analyzer helps you get pregnant, especially if you have PCOS or irregular periods when ordinary ovulation calendars and trackers are not so helpful. It also makes you save money! Now you can buy cheap test strips in bulk knowing that you will be confident about the results once and for all!\n\nFertility Test Analyzer reads pregnancy and ovulation test strips, interprets their results and shows them in an easy and understandable way. Be reassured when reading the pigmentation level of an ovulation test or seeing a very faint line on a pregnancy test. Find out that you are pregnant before a missed period using the most sensitive tests in combination with our app. Join other pregnancy success stories! Using our  unique computer vision algorithm, Fertility Test Analyzer recognizes the pigmentation trace present in the test pad and gives you your long awaited answer.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\n✔ Read pregnancy and ovulation test strips without any doubts.\n✔ Detect ovulation based on your hormone levels.\n✔ Predict your fertile window.\n✔ Improve your chances of pregnancy by better timing intercourse.\n✔ Check on your pregnancy initial days following your hCG evolution with its fertility charts. \n✔ Access your data offline and review it when Internet access is not available.\n✔ Keep pictures of your tests safely saved in your mobile phone.\n\nIMPORTANT LIMITATIONS\nFertility Test Analyzer transforms qualitative data,given by the pregnancy and ovulation test strips, into quantitative data (% pigmentation). The accuracy of the numeric value is affected by a number of factors, such as: test quality, how diluted the urine is, the quality of the camera used, your skills in taking a good picture and a correct lighting. Hence, numeric results obtained cannot be taken as exact values, only a laboratory can give those.\nUse at your own risk. Do not use to avoid pregnancy or anything where more accuracy would be required. Please consult your healthcare provider for any health concern.\n\nAUTHORS' NOTE\nThe time has come to say goodbye.\n\nOver the last years we created and give support to Fertility Test Analyzer in our spare time as part of a non-profit project. Our intention was to help women to reach their dream of become mothers, and we are happy to see that it has over 70k installations at the time.\nSadly we have to admit that we don't have the resources to keep up on new devices and therefore we have taken the decision of release the app to the public domain under a commercial free license. We expect other fertility apps to use this technology in the near future and we think that this is the best way we have to contribute to the well being of women with fertility difficulties.\n\nUnfortunately we won't be giving support or maintenance to the app anymore. If you are an Android developer with some free time and want to contribute (there are a couple of things with priority if you have a modern device), the source code is on https://gitlab.com/colnix/fta. Please make a pull request or create a brand new app of your own! The only legal requirement is that you have to use it for good, not for evil :)\n\nThank you for join us throughout this project and we hope to see you soon in another adventure.\n\nMaría and Pablo\n",

But in the middle of the process it became clear that it would take much more time :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We completely redesigned the tutorial. We hope that it will be not too complicated for beginners, and, on the other hand, it will not be too dull for experienced players in 3d–action games.</li>\n<li>The minimap has completely changed. Instead of turning it on and off (as in the original Gloomy), it is now always visible. In addition, it always shows where to go (instead of arrows on the floor, as it was before), so you won’t get lost in endless labyrinths.</li>\n<li>The game was carefully rebalanced (it is a shame, but earlier we did it almost randomly). It’s up to you to decide whether we’ve done it well or not, but to our taste it became much more fun to play.</li>\n<li>We’ve added the ability to quickly change weapons (instead of constantly entering the menu). It seems to us that this is a handy feature, especially at the final levels, in order to quickly switch between grenades and winchester.</li>\n<li>And finally, the main feature that distinguishes this game from our previous ones is the use of procedural generation as a base for creating levels. Of course, we did not put the generated levels as is - each of them was corrected by hands with love. Nevertheless, it was procedural generation that set the basic structure and \"rhythm\" of the level. Perhaps, because of it, on some levels you will have to run back and forth, but, in our opinion, this adds something special to the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compared to Gloomy, this game is much more dynamic. No more boring monsters - only hardcore! If you loved 3D first person shooters (FPS), give this game a chance :)</p>\n<p>And briefly for the rest of the features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>35 levels.</li>\n<li>7 different weapons.</li>\n<li>More than 5000 enemies.</li>\n<li>About 5 hours of gameplay.</li>\n<li>24 achievements.</li>\n<li>Each level have one or more secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>In version for F-Droid analytics and crash reporting were removed. The game may display non-personalized advertising from EightSines Studio.</p>\n",

Thumbnails are added to the EXIF metadata structure.\n\nIt is designed to work from android Oreo (android 8, SDK 26).\n\nPlease report issues here: <a href=\"https://github.com/tenzap/exif-thumbnail-adder/issues\">https://github.com/tenzap/exif-thumbnail-adder/issues</a>\n\nFor more information, some known facts and how you may contribute, refer to the [project homepage][1].\n\n<b>Rationale</b>\n\nOn some smartphones, when wanting to import pictures to Windows (or any device/operating system supporting MTP or PTP protocols), I noticed the pictures may not display a thumbnail in the import wizard (whether through the Photos app, or through the Windows Explorer import feature).\n\nThere are two possible reasons for that behaviour. First, the thumbnail is not present in the picture, usually because the app that created the picture didn't add a thumbnail. Second, there is a thumbnail but it is ignored because some EXIF tags are missing.\n\n\n<b>Features</b>\n\n- Add thumbnail to pictures (JPEG) that don't yet have one\n- Lanczos algorithm to downsample picture thanks to [FFmpeg's swscale library][2] for best results.\n- Select one or more folders to scan from any storage (internal, SDCard...). For example DCIM, Pictures...\n- Exclude one subdirectory from selected directories\n- Preserve timestamps of the pictures\n- Processing log\n- Synchronize deleted files in the source directory to the backup and working directory (so that you don't keep in the backup folder pictures you don't have anymore in the source folder)\n- Conservative default options (backup pictures, skip corrupt files)\n- Install app on internal storage or external storage\n- Default EXIF library: [Exiv2][3].\n- Alternative libraries: Android-Exif-Extended, libexif, pixymeta-android.

    "description": "Usually, \"Digital Detoxing\" apps in Android are about opting-in for a contract to not use our phones for the next X minutes. Or that we will not use the app Y for more than Z minutes. These contracts are often reinforced with financial incentives, i.e. if we fail we will have to pay a fee of a few dollars to the developers.\n\nThis app follows a different approach by stripping away all the attention-grabbing and manipulative features of other apps. DetoxDroid does not require you to choose a time and place when you want to \"detox\", or punish you if you fail. Instead, it aims to enable you to use your phone rather than letting your phone use you.\n\nFEATURES\n* Grayscale: Going grayscale removes positive reinforcements and dampens compulsive smartphone use.\n* Exceptions: Exclude apps like your camera or gallery from the grayscale feature.\n* Automatic Do Not Disturb: Never forget to enter the \"Do Not Disturb\" mode.\n* Opt-out > Opt-in: Deliberately pause DetoxDroid rather than deliberately switching it on.\n\nINSTALLATION\nUnfortunately, installing the app on your phone is not enough for the grayscale feature to work. If your phone is rooted, you can grant the necessary permissions from the app. Otherwise, you need to grant the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission from your computer.\nDon't worry though, this usually will not take you more than a few minutes. Find out how to do it on GitHub: https://github.com/flxapps/DetoxDroid#installation\n\nSUPPORT DETOXDROID\nIf you like the project, please consider becoming a patron on LiberaPay or buying me a coffee via Ko-Fi/PayPal.

    "description": "KurobaEx is a fast Android app for browsing imageboards, such as 4chan. It's a fork of Kuroba. This fork provides lots of new features:\n\n* New technological stack (Kotlin, RxJava/Coroutines, Room etc).\n* On demand content loading (includes prefetching, youtube videos titles and durations fetching, inlined files size fetching etc).\n* Third-party archives support.\n* New thread navigation (tabs).\n* New in-app navigation (bottom nav bar).\n* New bookmarks (they were fully rewritten from scratch, now use way less memory, don't use wakelocks, show separate notifications per thread (and notifications can be swiped away).\n* Edge-to-edge theme support.\n* New database.\n* 4chan global search support.\n* Fully dynamic themes with Android Q Day/Night mode support.\n* Per-site proxies.\n* Ability to attach multiple media files to reply, attach media files that was shared by external apps (event by some keyboards), attach remote media files by URL, etc.\n* New image downloader. Allows downloading images while the app is in background, retrying failed to download images, resolving duplicates, etc. \n* New posting. Posting code was moved into a foreground service which now allows stuff using like automatic captcha solvers (2captcha API) seamlessly or queueing multiple replies in different threads (only one reply per thread).\n* New Media Viewer. It was rewritten from scratch and now lives in a separate activity. It now also supports stuff like viewing links to media files shared into the app.\n* Thread downloader with ability to export threads as HTML pages with all downloaded media.\n* Composite catalogs (ability to combine multiple boards of any available sites (except archives) together into a single catalog).\n* Mpv video player.\n* Lots of other tiny improvements.\n\nAntiFeatures:\n- NonFreeNet. The app has to connect to image board sites which may be closed source. \nThe app may connect to non-free services such as Google ReCaptcha (JS/no-JS), CloudFlare,\nGitHub (for some image resources), Youtube/SoundCloud/Streamable (to parse titles and durations),\nand other sites. This may depend on the site itself as well as the app settings.\n\nThe app uses some permissions that may be considered dangerous: \n- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED. It is used to listen to reboots and reschedule BookmarkWatcher service.\n- FOREGROUND_SERVICE. It is used by the service that shows a notification when a file is\ndownloaded (allows you cancel it).\n- WAKE_LOCK. It may be used on Android versions prior to API 23 to keep the device awake while\nBookmarkWatcher service is doing it's job.\n\nWhen making a reply on some sites the app may connect to Google's ReCaptcha services.\nThe app supports JavaScript and non-JavaScript based captcha systems. \nWhether to use a JS or no-JS captcha can be configured in the site settings (depends on the site).\n\nTo make the final APK smaller some of the static resources are stored on Github servers and are\nloaded lazily, so the app may connect to Github services.\n\nThe app uses it's own crash reporting system which is turned on by default.\nIt collects crash logs and other logs (prior the crash), stores them, but does not upload them\nautomatically. You have to do it manually. You can see what is being sent and even edit it\n(or delete crash logs). You can also completely disable collection of crash logs in the settings.\n(The server's source code can be found here https://github.com/K1rakishou/Kuroba-apk-server)",

    "summary": "remounts the SD Card to allow write access",
    "description": "This app tries to restore legacy SD Card write access, which has been removed in android 4.4 and newer.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\nThis is currently a very small and spontaneous project released in the hopes of being useful. While i take my best care to design this application to be stable and never harmful, i cannot guarantee any kind of safety. Use of this application happens on your own risk and discretion, especially since i can only test the application on the few devices that i own. If in major doubt, you might want to test the functionality of the app on your device with an unimportant SD Card first to eliminate any possiblity of data loss.\nThat being said, there's currently nothing destructive going on and misbehavior should entirely be limited to failure of enabling write access. Anything this app might currently do wrong if running on a wrong device should entirely be revertable by uninstalling it and remounting your SD Card.\n\n\n**What is this**\nWith android 4.4, Google decided that it would be time for a new and fancy way to access your internal storage and introduced the Storage Access Framework (SAF). You might have had some contact with it over time.\nSadly, with this new feature Google also decided to remove SD Card write access like it used to exist, forcing every app to go through SAF if they want to write something to the SD Card. This required each developer to update their apps. Until this day, some apps still do not support the SAF.\n\nThis app aims at allowing those apps to write to your SD Card again. It uses a method that should work on android 8.0 and above which involves remounting the SD Card, hence the name.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* A device with an SD Card slot\n* Root access, since the app remounts some stuff\n* Android 8.0 or later (but if you are running android 6.0.1, 7.0 or 7.1, it shouldn't hurt to just give it a shot)\n\nThe approach currently used by this app definitely only applies to devices running android 6 or later. It has successfully been tested with devices running android 8.1, 9 and 10 and unsucsessfully on devices running android 7.1, 6.0.1 and 5.1.\nWith android 10 & 11, storage access became more restricted, forcing all newer apps to go through SAF. It remains to be seen what this does to legacy storage access and this app, and what's to come with even newer android versions.\n\nFor more information, have a look at the [README](https://gitlab.com/giwiniswut/android-media-rw-remounter/-/blob/master/README.md) and the [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/giwiniswut/android-media-rw-remounter/-/wikis/Home).\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n* Install\n* Launch once\n* Grant permanent root access\n* Insert or remount some storage\n* Start writing files to the SD Card\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The app must be launched at least once or else the system won't ever run it. This is a security mechanism of the Android platform to protect users from apps they've never launched and maybe never wanted to use or install.\n* This restriction can be removed by installing the app as a privileged app, i.e. by writing the apk file to `/system/priv-app`.\n* Upon the first mount with this app installed, i.e. when you actively need to grant root access, it is possible that the app will do nothing. This is because the app will currently be terminated if it has to wait more than a few seconds for root access. Once root access has already been granted and the app is immediately given root access every time it needs it, everything should work as expected.\n\n\n**How do i know if my device is compatible?**\nTL;DR: Just give it a shot.\nUltimately, this app relies on how your specific device vendor chose to implement how your SD Card gets mounted and by which method write access gets removed. With pure android (AOSP), the approach with simple remounting of the SD Card will work from android 8.0 and above, where it uses `sdcardfs` to do the job, a special filesystem originally developed by Samsung. If you have a Samsung device, it's very much possible that it already uses `sdca",

    "description": "WaveUp is an app that <i>wakes up your phone</i> - switches the screen on - when you <i>wave</i> over the proximity sensor.\n\nI have developed this app because I wanted to avoid pressing the power button just to take a look at the watch - which I happen to do a lot on my phone. There are already other apps that do exactly this - and even more. I was inspired by Gravity Screen On/Off, which is a <b>great</b> app. However, I am a huge fan of open source software and try to install free software (free as in freedom, not only free as in free beer) on my phone if possible. I wasn't able to find an open source app that did this so I just did it myself. If you're interested, you can take a look at the code:\nhttps://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/wave-up\n\nJust wave your hand over the proximity sensor of your phone to turn the screen on. This is called <i>wave mode</i> and can be disabled in the settings screen in order to avoid accidental switching on of your screen.\n\nIt will also turn on the screen when you take your smartphone out of your pocket or purse. This is <i>called pocket mode</i> and can also be disabled in the settings screen.\n\nBoth of these modes are enabled by default.\n\nIt also locks your phone and turns off the screen if you cover the proximity sensor for one second (or a specified time). This does not have a special name but can nonetheless be changed in the settings screen too. This is not enabled by default.\n\nFor those who have never heard proximity sensor before: it is a small thingie that is somewhere near where you put your ear when you speak on the phone. You practically can't see it and it is responsible for telling your phone to switch off the screen when you're on a call.\n\n<b>Uninstall</b>\n\nThis app uses the Device Administrator permission. Therefore you cannot uninstall WaveUp 'normally'.\n\nTo uninstall it, just open it and use the 'Uninstall WaveUp' button at the bottom of the menu.\n\n<b>Known issues</b>\n\nUnfortunately, some smartphones let the CPU on while listening to the proximity sensor. This is called a <i>wake lock</i> and causes considerable battery drain. This isn't my fault and I cannot do anything to change this. Other phones will \"go to sleep\" when the screen is turned off while still listening to the proximity sensor. In this case, the battery drain is practically zero.\n\n<b>Required Android Permissions:</b>\n\n▸ WAKE_LOCK to turn on the screen\n▸ USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK to lock the device\n▸ RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED to automatically startup on boot if selected\n▸ READ_PHONE_STATE to suspend WaveUp while on a call\n\n<b>Miscellaneous notes</b>\n\nThis is the first Android app I have ever written, so beware!\n\nThis is also my first small contribution to the open source world. Finally!\n\nI would love if you could give me feedback of any kind or contribute in any way!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nOpen source rocks!!!\n\n<b>Translations</b>\n\nIt would be really cool if you could help translate WaveUp to your language (even the English version could probably be revised).\nIt's available for translation as two projects on Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/waveup/ and https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/libcommon/.\n\n<b>Acknowledgments</b>\n\nMy special thanks to:\n\nSee: https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/wave-up/#acknowledgments\n",

We have changed the code from Java to Kotlin and it functions in Android 5-12.\nNuSimi has a free/open source GPL 3.0+ license and its code is available at https://github.com/KetanoLab, so that you can improve and adapt it for your needs. It includes Simidic Builder to import additional dictionaries in StarDict format.

    "summary": "A component controller for Android applications",
    "description": "Blocker is a component controller for Android applications that currently supports using PackageManager and Intent Firewall to manage the state of components. It can be seamlessly switched between these controllers, and for application rules, you can export and import them. Additionally, it is compatible with backup files generated by MyAndroidTools, and you can effortlessly convert them to Intent Firewall rules. The application also has the potential to be extended in the future.\n\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n\n1. Lightweight, don't burden the system\n2. Easy to use\n3. Supports multiple control types\n\n<h3>Introduction to different component controllers</h3>\n<h4>Package Manager</h4>\nThe Android system provides a tool called PackageManager, which is used for managing installed applications or obtaining information about them. One of its methods, ```setComponentEnabledSetting(ComponentName, int, int)```, allows an application to control the state of its own components. If attempting to use this method to control components in other applications, a signature permission is required, or the call will fail.\n\nFortunately, Android provides another tool called \"pm\" that allows users to control component states in command-line mode. However, the \"pm\" tool requires root permission to run. The following command can be used to disable a specific package or component:\n\n```\npm disable [PackageName/ComponmentName]\n```\n\nWhether using PackageManager in the code or \"pm\" in command-line mode, the configurations will be written to ```/data/system/users/0/package_restrictions.xml```.\n\n<h4>Intent Firewall Mode</h4>\nIntent Firewall was introduced in Android 4.4.2 (API 19) and is still effective in the latest Android systems. It is integrated into the Android Framework to filter the intents sent by applications or systems.\n\n<h5>What Intent Firewall can do</h5>\nEach intent sent by an application is filtered by the Intent Firewall, with rules stored in XML files. The Intent Firewall updates rules immediately if changes occur in the configuration file.\n\n<h5>Limitations of Intent Firewall</h5>\nOnly system applications can read and write the directory where the configuration file is stored, and third-party applications do not have permission to access it.\n\n<h5>Differences between Intent Firewall and Package Manager</h5>\nIntent Firewall, indeed it is a firewall, it has no impact on component status. The application detects the component is on, but it just cannot start the component.\n\nFor the components disabled by PackageManager, if an application starts it, an exception will be thrown. Developers can catch this exception to know whether the component is disabled or not, so they could re-enable this component. That's the reason why the components will be enabled unexpectedly. If you are using an Intent Firewall controller, there will be no problems.\n\n<h3>UI</h3>\nThe app was designed using Material 3 guidelines.\nHuge thanks to our UI designer: @COPtimer (https://github.com/COPtimer)\n\nThe Screens and UI elements are built entirely using Jetpack Compose.\n\nThe app has two themes:\n\nDynamic color - uses colors based on the user's current color theme (if supported)\n\nDefault theme - uses predefined colors when dynamic color is not supported\n\nEach theme also supports dark mode.",

Just open the app and tap the button for the type of tea you're brewing. That's it. No need to navigate through complicated menus to find a particular tea, or fiddle with settings... unless you want to customize brew times or add your own favorite teas.\n\nOnce you tap, Cuppa will begin timing the brew and you'll see a teabag appear in the cup and gradually darken as the tea steeps. A countdown timer shows the steep time remaining. You can have up to two separate teas brewing at once, each with its own countdown timer. When the tea is done Cuppa will let you know with a notification -- depending on your device settings, this may be accompanied by a sound and/or vibration.\n\nWe hope you find Cuppa for your mobile device useful!",

This is an app that is itself a reflection of meditation's purpose.\n\nPossibly the most important feature of this app is the ability to customize the volume of the notification bells independently of system volume. This allows you to set a predefined volume so that the sounds will reliably play at the same volume every time. No more mid-meditation worrying about whether you remembered to turn the volume up!\n\nAnother important feature is for the timer countdown itself to be as reliable as possible, so that there is no doubt the timeout will sound at the right moment and not be delayed.\nThis is achieved by starting a foreground service and disabling battery optimization (for this last one you'll be asked for the permission).\n\nReliability is of extreme importance to a meditation tool in order to eliminate all possible worries about the timer not behaving correctly.

    "description": "ForgetMeNot is an app for memorizing information via flashcards. Simplicity, usability, speed were taken into account in the process of developing this educational program. This app provides excellent conditions for achieving high efficiency of memorization.\n\n\nThe features that are supported are:\n\n    • Import/export of files.\n    • Support CSV, Tab text or any other kind of Delimiter-Separated Values.\n    • Intervals (Spaced repetition). You can specify your own interval scheme for each deck. Also it is possible to indicate one's own algorithm of how the answers affects the choice of the next interval.\n    • Several test methods. There are 'Self testing', 'Testing with variants', 'Spell check'.\n    • Pronunciation of the text via TTS. You can choose languages for questions and answers, enable autospeaking of them.\n    • Hiding the text of a question to stimulate improvement of listening skills that is very useful in foreign language learning.\n    • Card inversion.\n    • Hints in the form of masking letters.\n    • 'Motivational timer' that will make you concentrate on your studies (optionally).\n    • Saving settings of deck as presets and reusing them in order to avoid routine work on settings.\n    • Editing and searching cards right in the exercise.\n    • 'Walking mode' that enables you do the exercise without looking at the screen.\n    • 'Autoplaying mode'. In this mode questions and answers are pronounced sequentially. You can combine your own activities and repetition of teaching material.\n    • Catalog of pre-made decks. The catalog contains many decks for language learning, which includes basic sets of words, thematic words and phrases, whole sentences.\n    • Grouping decks into separate lists.\n    • Customizing the card appearance.\n    • Dark theme.\n    • Backup.\n\n\nWhat makes ForgetMeNot so efficient for memorizing:\n\n    - No amount of advertising. You can handle a lot of cards in a short time due to the simplicity and convenience of the user interface. Nothing prevents you from studying.\n    - The exercise is designed so that you must eventually grasp the answer. If your answer is wrong, the card is postponed to the end of the list until you answer correct.\n    - Intervals (Spaced repetition). Spaced repetition reduces the forgetting that occurs when material is not encountered for a significant time period. It also involves actively recalling learned material, which supports learning.\n    - Possibility to edit a card just in the exercise. This allows you not only to correct mistakes, but also to rebuild cards if they are difficult to remember. For example, you can add an additional association in parentheses.\n    - Voice accompaniment. This is especially helpful when learning languages because it improves listening skills, helps to focus on studying and favors memorization. You can even set up a deck to perceive a question exceptionally by ear.\n    - Modes that allow you to practice not only in your free time. 'Walking mode' enables you do the exercise during walking. 'Autoplaying mode' lets you listen to questions and answers when your hands and eyes are busy, but your ears are free : )\n    - Focusing aids. 'Motivational timer' reminds you when you've lost your attention. Full screen mode hides the status bar, which might be an additional source of distraction.\n\n\nForgetMeNot is free and open-source software.\nhttps://github.com/tema6120/ForgetMeNot",

The game is known by many names Nonograms, Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Hanjie and various others.\n\n- Modes\nThere are two game modes. You can either practice on a pre-made grid, or you can play a randomly generated grid with custom parameters.\n\n- How to play\nThe game is relatively simple, the number in each row/column corresponds to the number of filled cells in that row/column. So '3 5' at the beginning of a column means there is a block of 3 cell and a block of 5 cell in that column which are not touching. Once you have the grid in front of you it will all make sense\n\n- Notes\nThe camera permission is used to share puzzles using QR codes\nNonograms are also known by many other names, including Paint by Numbers, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Picross, Picma, PrismaPixels, Pixel Puzzles, Crucipixel, Edel, FigurePic, Hanjie, HeroGlyphix, Illust-Logic, Japanese Crosswords, Japanese Puzzles, Kare Karala!, Logic Art, Logic Square, Logicolor, Logik-Puzzles, Logimage, Oekaki Logic, Oekaki-Mate, Paint Logic, Picture Logic, Tsunamii, Paint by Sudoku and Binary Coloring Books\n",

You are one tap away from switching accounts, and everything refreshes on the switch so that you can view other accounts instantaneously. Furthermore, the notification service will fetch notifications from all accounts, and will let you know which account has the new notification.\n• <b>Better multitasking</b> - Frost contains an overlaying web browser that can be drawn on top of your foreground task. Open links and notifications with a full screen view, then swipe away to get back to your previous task.\n• <b>Contextual awareness</b> - Frost integrates additional features via long presses. Need to copy a block of text or share a link? Long press the text. Need to zoom into an image or download it? Long press the image!\n• <b>Material Design</b> - Built for lollipop and up, Frost focuses strongly on a beautiful and functional UI, and embraces material transitions and dimensions.\n• <b>Complete theme engine</b> - Frost contains very comprehensive themes that customize all components of the app. Frost is also the only app to support transparent themes.\n• <b>Fully opened</b> - Nothing speaks for privacy more than being open sourced. Frost is proud to be one of those apps, and can be found on github (Link in the app's about section)\n• <b>Fixes the little things</b> - Frost is community driven, and many tweaks are added to address minor inconveniences and give a full native experience, despite being a web app. To list a few:\n&emsp;&emsp; • Focusing on a text input will prevent refreshing, so you don't accidentally swipe and lose your progress.\n&emsp;&emsp; • Horizontal swipe can be enabled along side the viewpager swipe with a simple long press\n&emsp;&emsp; • Automatic bug reports are sent when a crash is detected, so even if you don't contact the devs, you are helping contribute by using the app.\n\nMandatory permissions used and why:\n\n• Internet, Network State, Wifi State - Frost fetches the pages from Facebook's mobile website. It also needs the network state so as to limit internet usage when you are on a metered network.\n• Receive Boot Completed - Frost notifications persist on reboot, and need this permission to be added each time.\n• Vibrate - Needed to vibrate phone for notifications; this can be toggled in the settings\n• Billing - For purchasing pro and unlocking all of Frost's features\n\nOptional permissions used and why:\n<i>(these are only requested when they have to be, and are disabled until then)</i>\n\n• Read/write external storage - Needed to upload photos in a new status and save photos when prompted\n• Fine/coarse location - Needed for the check in option if users wish to search for their location\n\n• That's it! No privacy intrusion and no extra demands.\n\nPermissions <i>NOT</i> used and why:\n\n• Wakelock - Frost takes advantage of Android's Job Scheduler, and lets the framework decide when to run background services. Frost therefore doesn't need to constantly run in the background, nor does it force your phone to stay awake.\n• Retrieve running apps - Frost has no need to access external apps or see what else is running\n• Identity - Frost manages its accounts internally and uses it solely to give you access to your account. We don't depend on other personal information and we don't even save your email.\n• Camera - While the camera permission can be added to allow you to directly take photos and upload them, we've decided that it would be best to allow you to do so externally and then share the photo with Frost\n\n* Frost is a third party app and is in no way affiliated with Facebook Inc.*",

    "description": "QR Codes become more and more important. In some areas they have even replaced the traditional barcode. A QR Code is able to store up to seven thousand characters and therefore is qualified for more complex content, e.g. vCards. Hence nowadays QR Codes can nowadays be found on nearly every advertisement poster and animate the user to scan it with his smartphone. Thus, it is no longer necessary take a hand written note, it is enough to scan the QR Code. Correspondingly, there are already many QR Code scanner apps available in the Google Play Store. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität Darmstadt. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfa\n\nOur Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App differs with respect to two aspects:\n\n1. The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App only requires the minimum amount of permissions, namely:\nMost of the QR Code scanner apps available in the Google Play Store need several permissions on top of the ones needed: e.g. reading contacts or your call log and retrieving data from the Internet. Most of these requirements are not necessary for the functionality they actually are supposed to provide.\n\n2. The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App supports its users in detecting malicious links: QR Codes provide new possibilities for an attacker, as QR Codes can contain malicious links, i.e. links to phishing webpages or webpages from which malware would automatically be downloaded. Therefore it is important to carefully check the link before accessing the corresponding webpage. Since it is difficult for the user to spot malicious links, the Privacy friendly QR Scanner App supports the user by highlighting the domain (e.g. in that case for https://www.secuso.org, secuso.org would be highlighted). To avoid not checking the link and in particular the highlighted domain carefully, the app provides information about possible fraud and its users need to confirm that they checked the link and it is trustworthy. Note, the information shown after scanning an URL based QR Code is not customized for every URL. Hence, it should be considered as an advice for the user how to behave in general.\n\nThe Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App supports most of the usual qr code types. Bar codes and other widely used codes are also supported.\n\nThe app belongs to the group of privacy friendly apps, that are developed by the SECUSO research group.

The developer recommends that you download Shattered Pixel Dungeon from an official channel, such as its Github releases page: https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/releases</b></u>\n\n<b>Shattered Pixel Dungeon</b> is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with five different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n<b>Choose Your Hero</b>\n\nEach of ShatteredPD's five playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Cut down foes as the durable Warrior or deadly Duelist, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\n<b>Explore the Dungeon</b>\n\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\n<b>Succeed or Die Trying</b>\n\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\n<b>A Decade in the Making</b>\n\nShatteredPD is based on the open source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in late 2012). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years! https://f-droid.org/packages/com.watabou.pixeldungeon",

We help you keep track of money moving out of your account into different types of investment.\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>This app is not a budget management tool, we're not here to manage your day to day spending. This application is here to track all the investment you make. So for example you have invested money in stocks, etfs, bonds, retirement fund, high yield savings account, Fixed deposits, gold bar in your locker or just some money in your savings account. This app will allow you to list all this investments and categorize it for you into different categories/sector of investment. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This application will allow you to record what type of application/service you used to invest your money (For example you use couple of brokers to manage your stock portfolio, this application will allow you to list through which website/app had you invested your money. So when you open this app, it should be easier for you to notice which app to check for particular investment)  And best part is it will calculate the amount invested in each category and show you a graph showing percentage of investment done in all various categories. So consider this application as your one step way to see all the money that you invest in all the places.</p>\n<p>   Ofcourse you can do all this using Microsoft Excel as well. But we're not competing with Excel. We're here to give you an alternative way to check your finances. If you prefer to use excel, use that. But make sure your excel file is password protected and with you at all times. Because this application has fingerprint authentication and is installed on your phone on all times. So you just need to take out your phone and will be able to check your investments. (I personally don't like using excel sheet and haven't seen any of my friends commit themselve to use excel sheet to manage their finances for long time. That's the reason I decided to create this application, and as there is an alternative with excel I decided to make it opensource and free. So if you don't like excel to manage your finances, you can jump on to this application.) </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I've also created a widget for this application. So you can just glimpse over your total invested amount on the homescreen itself. Yeah it's not safe to show this amount on the homescreen but I developed this feature just in case, any of us need any push to continue their job/business. Seeing that total invested amount on the home screen can motivate you to just give that little extra. If you don't feel it's safe to show the amount there, don't use the widget. But I gave that option just in case anyone wants to use it. And you can even place this widget on the different homescreen. So unless you swipe to it, no body else will even know it's there.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you've added your investment data, you can share the data you inserted using Export data option in settings tab. You'll be able to share your data as an excel file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Just to be clear, this application is not a portfolio tracker. There are plenty of applications that do that already.

    "description": "The only way to prevent data from being abused is to prevent it from being collected in the first place. Privacy Browser has two primary goals.\n\n1. Minimize the data that is sent to the internet.\n\n2. Minimize the data that is stored on the device.\n\nMost browsers silently give websites massive amounts of information that allows them to track you and compromise your privacy. Websites and ad networks use technologies like JavaScript, cookies, DOM storage, user agents, and many other things to uniquely identify each user and track them between visits and across the web.\n\nIn contrast, privacy sensitive features are disabled by default in Privacy Browser. If one of these technologies is required for a website to function correctly, the user may choose to turn it on for just that visit. Or, they can use domain settings to automatically turn on certain features when entering a specific website and turn them off again when leaving.\n\nPrivacy Browser currently uses Android’s built-in WebView to render web pages. As such, it works best when the latest version of WebView is installed (see https://www.stoutner.com/privacy-browser/common-settings/webview/). In the 4.x series, Privacy Browser will switch to a forked version of Android’s WebView called Privacy WebView that will allow for advanced privacy features.\n\nFeatures:\n• Integrated EasyList ad blocking.\n• Tor Orbot proxy support.\n• SSL certificate pinning.\n• Import/export of settings and bookmarks.",

    "description": "Privacy Cell is a small app that displays the cell phone protocol information.\n\nAt the time of this writing, many cell phone networks are switching from 4G (4th Generation) to 5G networks. The 5G network protocols were specifically designed to protect against some of the known insecurities of the older protocols, including those that allowed stingrays (IMSI catchers) to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on cell phone networks. To ease deployment and backwards compatibility, 4G and 5G networks can run together in what is known as 5G NR (New Radio) NSA (Non-Standalone) mode. This uses the 4G network for the control channel and the 5G network for the data communication. However, 5G NR NSA does not provide protection against stingrays. Android has access to all the information it needs to know if it is connected to a 5G NR NSA or a 5G NR SA (Standalone) network, but it doesn’t display that information to the user. The purpose of Privacy Cell is to make that information easy to access.\n\nPrivacy Cell can also warn you when you are connected to antiquated 2G and 3G networks.",

When the Phoenix Radio boots (or fast-boots), \nthe Alt Launcher starts the apps it is configured to start. The primary purpose \nis to launch two apps in split screen mode. You can select which app to be on \nthe top half of the screen, and the app for the bottom half. Prior to starting \nthose apps, it can launch services or apps that need to run in the background.\n\nInstallation Note: The Alt Launcher does not show up in the launcher that comes \nwith the Phoenix radios. During the installation process, be sure to click the \n\"Open\" button to run it once. From that point on, it will run in the \nbackground. If you don't start it during the installation process, the only way \nto start it is with another app that launches apps (like CarWebGuru).\n\nAccessing the app\n\nTo get into the Alt Launcher, swipe down from the top of the screen to view \nnotifications, and click on the \"Alt Launcher\" notification. It has the \nmessage \"Foreground Service Started\". If the notification is not available, \nstart the Alt Launcher using a non-stock launcher like CarWebGuru.\n\nIn the main scren, the Alt Launcher displays the services, background apps, and top and bottom apps it is configured to start on booot or fast boot.\n\nBackground Apps\n\nAt the top of the main screen is the list of apps that will start and then be \nput in the background. They are started in the order shown. To add a new one, \nclick the \"Add a new Background App\" button, and select the desired app. To \nremove an app from the list, click on that app.\n\nServices\n\nBelow the background apps is the list of services that will be started. They \nare started in the order shown. To add a new one, click the \"Add New Service to \nStart\" button, and select the desired service. To remove a service, click on \nthe service.\n\nTop and Bottom Apps\n\nBelow the background apps are the two apps to launch in split screen mode. To \nselect the top or bottom app, click on either \"None Selected\" or the app shown \nin either the top or bottom sections, and choose the desired app in the popup.\n\nPermissions\n\nThe app requires the following permissions:\n1. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - needed to be notified after cold boot so it can launch the apps.\n2. FOREGROUND_SERVICE - The default launcher on Phoenix Radios hides the application icon for the Alt Launcher. This means that by default, there is no way to get into the app to update configuration. The foreground service provides a consistent way to get back into the app.\n\nTasker\n\nTo start Tasker so that it starts performing actions after boot, do the \nfollowing:\n\n1. Select the following Tasker service to be launched: \ncom.joaomgcd.taskerm.plugin.ServiceRequestQuery\ni. There is generally no need to launch the Tasker app itself.\n2. In Tasker, if you set up a profile with Profile->Event->Tasker->\nMonitor Start, that activates when Tasker starts up.\n\n\nSee the \n<a href=\"https://github.com/tabletradio/altlauncher/blob/master/README.md\">\nReadme</a> for additional details.\n",

When you do so, a window containing information about the url is displayed, allowing you to make changes to it as well.\nSpecially useful when you need to open an external link either from an email, a social network app or others.\n\n\nURLCheck is developed by TrianguloY, originally for personal use. It is open source (under CC BY 4.0 license), free, without any ads or trackers, light sized and using as few permissions as necessary (only the internet permission, for module checks that will only be performed when the user request them). The source code is available on GitHub too, if you want to suggest changes, perform modifications or propose a new translation: https://github.com/TrianguloY/UrlChecker\n\n\nThe app is structured with a modular setup, you can enable/disable and reorder individual modules, which include:\n\n* Input text: Displays the current url which can be edited manually. Can't be disabled.\n\n* History: View and revert any change from other modules, including edits from the user (typical undo/redo feature)\n\n* Log: Keeps a log of all checked urls, which you can view, edit, copy, clear...\n\n* Status code: By pressing the button a petition will be made to retrieve that url, and the status code will be displayed (ok, server error, not found...). Additionally, if it corresponds to a redirection, press the message to check the new url. The url is fetched, but not evaluated, so redirection based on javascript won't be detected.\n\n* Url Scanner: Allows you to scan the url using VirusTotal, and check the report. A free personal VirusTotal API key is needed for it to work. VirusTotal™ is a trademark of Google, Inc.\n\n* Url Cleaner: Uses the ClearURLs catalog to remove referral and useless parameters from the url. It also allows for common offline url redirections. Built-in catalog from https://docs.clearurls.xyz/latest/specs/rules/\n\n* Unshortener: Uses https://unshorten.me/ to unshorten urls remotely.\n\n* Queries remover: Displays the decoded individual url queries, which you can remove or check.\n\n* Pattern module: Checks the url with regex patterns that warns, suggests or applies replacements. You can modify or create your own patterns, or even use user-created ones.\nBuilt-in patterns include:\n    - Warning when contains non-ascii characters like greek letters. This can be used for phishing: googĺe.com vs google.com\n    - Suggest replacing 'http' with 'https'\n    - Suggest replacing Youtube, Reddit or Twitter with privacy-friendly alternatives [disabled by default]\n\n* Hosts checker: This module labels hosts, configured either by specifying them manually or by using a remote hosts-like file. You can use it to warn about dangerous or special sites. The builtin configuration specifies StevenBlack's hosts (adware/malware, fakenews, gambling and adult content) from https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts\n\n* Debug module: Displays the intent uri, and optionally info about the ctabs (custom tabs) service. This is intended for developers.\n\n* Open module: Contains the open and share buttons. If a link can be opened with multiple apps, an arrow will be shown to let you choose. Can't be disabled.\n",

Or you can display all tasks that have either category \"Family\" or \"Friends\".\n\n<b>Sorting tasks:</b>\nThe task list can be sorted by:\n* completion_status\n* due_date/due_time\n* priority\n* category\n* name\nAny sort order is possible. E.g. first by due_date/time, then by completion status, category, priority and name. Or any other order you prefer.\n\n<b>Searching tasks:</b>\nTasks can be searched by text. The search text you enter can be applied to the task name, the task description, or both.\nCase-sensitive search is possible.\nIn the list of search results, when displaying details of a task, the search string is highlighted in the task name and / or description.\n\n<b>Convenience:</b>\nThere are shortcuts for often used actions. E.g.\n* From the context menu of a category you can jump to a list of all tasks for that category.\n* From the context menu of a task you can change its completion_status, set it to DONE (or OPEN respectively), or set its due date to today or tomorrow.\n* When the task list is filtered by \"tasks due TODAY\", you can easily move to the previous / next day by swiping right / left.\n* Similarly, by swiping you can easily move to the previous / next week (when the task list is filtered by \"tasks due CURRENT_WEEK\"), or to the previous / next category (when all tasks for a category are displayed).\n\n<b>Display:</b>\nTasks due in the past, today, or in the future have different background colors, so they are easily discernible.\nThe color scheme adapts to the display mode of the underlying android. I.e. if dark mode is selected (provided your android does support dark mode), a dark color scheme is used also for toodoo.\n\n<b>Import / Export:</b>\nAll user data (i.e. tasks, categories, filters and sort criteria) can be exported to an external file (xml-format).\nVice versa, data can be imported from an external file.\n\n<b>Technical:</b>\nYour data is stored locally on your device.\nNo connection to the internet needed.\nNo ads. No tracking.\n\n\n<b>Restrictions</b>\ntoodoo is minimalistic. It focuses on managing, categorizing, filtering, and sorting tasks (however, more features may be added in future releases.)\nThus, there are some restriction, i.e.:\n\n* The user interface is in English only.\n\n* Name of folder and file for export data are fixed (i.e. /Download/toodoo/toodooData-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss)\n\n* Settings are currently fixed, e.g.\n- date format is yyyy-mm-dd, time format is 24 hours.\n- first day of week is Monday.\n- within a day, tasks without due_time are sorted behind tasks with due_time.\n",

This saved domains always overwrite the current profile. So, for example, \"github.com\" will always open with the trusted profile, even if you are browsing in the protected mode.\n\nMore privacy features:\n\n• Build in AdBlock, which updates automatically. You can decide which content to block.

VideLibri on the other hand stores all data on your smartphone, so the due date is always already there and does not need to arrive.\n- Renewing of borrowed books, manually or automatically before the due date to extend the lending period.\n- History of all borrowed books, so you can always look back at the books you had borrowed in the past, even after the books were returned to the library and are not shown anymore in the library OPAC.\n- Turing-complete XQuery search in the history that can answer arbitrary complex queries, like which borrowed book had the longest title and was borrowed more than once? \n- Search in the OPAC for non-lent books as well as ordering and reserving of non-lent books in some libraries.\n- Developed since the year 2006, it is the world's first universal library app and any other library app is a VideLibri copycat.\n- Open-source\n\n\n\nSome larger public libraries that were tested successfully are for example in the cities Augsburg, GGG Basel, Berlin, Bielefeld, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Lübeck, or Linz, or Munich.\n\nThe entire list of all tested libraries and OPACs is too long for the app store page, but you can find it at https://videlibri.de/bibliotheken.html . \n\n\nThe Android part of VideLibri has been translated into English. However, since most libraries in the list are German, they have German books with German titles. Additional resources like documentation and changelog written for the original VideLibri Windows app in 2006 remain in German. The Windows and Linux app are currently being translated.\n\n",

Try this one, most likely it will work if background noise subsides :-)\n\nAdditionally, you can choose one of four available pitch tracking algorithms.\n\nWith the downward flowing histogram of pitch, the user gets an intuitive grip on what is going on while in the process of tuning the instrument.\n\nMany thanks to izzy for support, all of you out there who really want to know what is going on inside your android phone check out his page:\n\nhttps://android.izzysoft.de/articles.php\n\ngreetings, and don't forget to play your guitar.\n",

Imagine this scenario: You have 45 minutes time to go for a walk, so you should go back after the half of the time. So, set the timer duration to 45 minutes, define a break after the half of the time and start the timer. Now you get a notification (audio signal, vibration, device notification) when the half of the time is reached, AND of course when the complete time is reached.\n\nOther scenarios could be to get notified every quarter of a duration to keep a feeling of the passing and remaining time. Or to get notifications short before the end of the duration.\n\nThe notifications are encoded in patterns of audio beeps and/or vibrations to express the reached in-between break. The pattern is very simple: a short beep means \"1\", a long beeeeep means \"5\". So, e.g. \"beeeeep beep\" means \"6\". All signals are prefixed with a short \"bepbep\" sequence to attract attention.\n\nWith the audio and vibration patterns you can even get notified about the timer progress without pulling your phone out of the pocket and looking on it. This is also very handy during workouts.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n - up to 20 notifications (\"breaks\") during a timer run \n - acoustic and haptic feedback \n - intuitive patterns to recognise current reached break\n - two different timer modes, \"Timer\" and \"Clock\"\n - different \"break\" presets\n - storing own presets\n - different color schemes\n\n\nFor more information see <a href=\"https://bdt.jepfa.de\">bdt.jepfa.de</a>\n\nIf you like the app please star it on <a href=\"https://github.com/jenspfahl/BDT\">Github</a>\n\n",

    "description": "<b>This is ANOTHER way to manage passwords!</b>\n\nANOTHERpass generates easy but strong passwords for you. It uses so called <i>Pseudo Phrases</i> by default which looks like real words but are still very random and unpredictable.\n\nIt also comes with a clever two factor authentication to login into the credential vault. These factors are knowledge (a PIN) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the PIN and have your master password with you (as QR code or NFC tag). Additionally you can safely store it on your device using biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).\n\nWith ANOTHERpass you can store backups of the vault and the encrypted master key separately (latter e.g. as QR code on a analogue sheet). So the backup file is very useless for hackers and can safely be stored on cloud drives.\n\n\n<b>Core features of the app</b>\n\n- easy two factor authentication\n- no complicated master password to memorize, it is just exported\n- easy to read generated passwords\n- strong modern encryption (AES 128/256, Blowfish, Chacha20)\n- uses an integrated security chip or TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) if present\n- Autofill support\n- biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) for stored master password\n- no insecure clipboard function by default\n- show passwords over other apps to type it easily\n- no internet connection needed, all is offline\n- export and import credential vault\n- export vault and master key separately (latter analogue if wished)\n- share and outsource credentials\n- obfuscate several passwords as additional security layer\n- optional self desctruction mode after too many failed login attempts\n- Dark theme support ;-)\n\nFor detailed information see <a href=\"https://anotherpass.jepfa.de\">anotherpass.jepfa.de</a>\n\nIf you like the app please star it on <a href=\"https://github.com/jenspfahl/ANOTHERpass\">Github</a>!\n",

With new multi-player mode \"Stone Wars\"!\n\nDifferent game pieces are to be inserted in a 10 x 10 large playing field. Horizontal rows or vertical columns are removed as soon as they are full. As the game progresses, more tile shapes are added again and again. Game pieces can be rotated by tapping. What high score will you achieve?\n\nParking: A game piece can be parked in the gray field. But be careful! As soon as no more pieces can be inserted in the playing field or in the parking area, the game is over! So play the parked game piece as quickly as possible!\n\nRotate the game piece by tapping it.\n\nGravitation: If horizontal rows are cleared in the lower playing field, the upper part slides down.\n\nPoints system:\n - Insert: number of blocks on the piece\n - Clear row: 10 points\n - clear away several rows at once: bonus points\n - The playing field has only 1 block left or is empty: extra bonus! After that the playing field must be filled 40%.\n - 20 connected pieces of one color result in a further extra bonus.\n - Star block gives 200 bonus points!\n\nBlock Puzzle Stone Wars\n\nWhile the old game (with randomly generated game pieces) has been retained, a new multi-player mode has been added: Stone Wars. You are on a spaceship and you have to liberate the galaxy. In the distant future, conflicts will be resolved by playing Block Puzzle. Navigate through a star cluster of tens of planets at lightning speed thanks to the spur drive. Little by little, the space map is revealed. The planets are of different sizes and have different gravity, which affects the game. The liberation takes place through the Block Puzzle Classic Game or through the new Cleaner Game.\nIn the Cleaner Game, you win by clearing the playing field. However, if your enemy needs fewer moves, he is the liberator of the planet. In the Classic Game, however, a high score counts. A minimum liberation score (MLS) must be achieved in the Classic Game. In some cleaner games, a certain number of moves may not be exceeded (XLM).\n\nSince the epochal data breach 200 years ago, a data processing system is no longer allowed to send or receive data. Therefore, you have to exchange your score with your friends or enemies via another app (e.g. WhatsApp). Enter your player name, which is as unique as possible, and copy the score of the current quadrant in the data exchange. Then go to WhatsApp, for example, and add the game status there. The recipient can then copy this saved game and paste it into the Stone Wars data exchange. You then take over all planets in his game where you are better than him. Will he be able to drive you out again?\n\nStone Wars works in such a way that you first select a planet in the navigation and click Select. Then tap back on the phone and start the liberation. All game pieces are predefined in terms of type and order.\n\nOur program is and will remain free and ad-free. There will be no in-app purchases. It does not require any phone rights and is played completely offline.\n",

    "description": "This is the Android version of Freebloks 3D, an implementation of the famous board game Blokus. Try to place as many tiles on the board as possible, keeping in mind only two simple rules: your tiles must touch a corner of one of your previously placed tiles, but they must not share an edge. Can you play more tiles than your opponents? \n\nRULES\nEach player has 21 Tetris-like tiles: 12 tiles with 5 squares, 5 tiles with 4 squares, 2 tiles with 3 squares, 1 tile with 2 squares and 1 tile with 1 square. \nPlayers take turns in placing one tile onto the 20x20 board. The first tile for each player has to be placed in their corner of the board. Each following tile has to touch a corner of one of your previous tiles, but it must never share an edge. It may share edges with the opponents' tiles though. \nIf a player has no more possible move, they have to pass. The game is over when no player can place a tile. \nFor each player, the squares of all their tiles on the board are added up. The player with the most points  wins. \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n- Swipe the list of available tiles with your finger. \n- Select and drag a tile onto the board. \n- Rotate or flip the tile using the 4 handles. \n- Place the tile in the desired position. The tile will appear green if the position is valid, and red otherwise. Possible corners are highlighted on the board for convenience. \n- Tap the tile in a valid position to place it. \n- You can rotate the board at any time to see the opponents' tiles. \n\nQuit the app at any time, your current game will be saved and restored on next start. \n\nFEATURES\n- Supports 2-player modes, with 2 colors (Original and Blokus Duo), 4 colors (2 each).\n- Customizable board sizes other than 20x20.\n- Play against the computer or humans on the same device. \n- Play online against your friends\n- Hint and undo options.\n- Looks great on tablets, too!\n\nThe game is network-compatible with Freebloks 3D for Windows and Linux: http://www.saschahlusiak.de/freebloks-3d/ \n\nPLEASE DONATE\nFreebloks 3D is absolutely free, open source and without advertisement! But things for free still have a value. You can decide how much Freebloks is worth to you by purchasing an in-app donation of your choice or by buying Freebloks VIP: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.saschahlusiak.freebloksvip\n\nThe complete source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/shlusiak/Freebloks-Android \n\nIf you have any idea, feature request or wish concerning the game, just drop us an email: apps@saschahlusiak.de \n\nSimilar: Blokish and Blokr!\n",

Afterward, you can view at which locations the device has tracked you. For this we use background location access. All location data never leaves your device\n\nIf no one is trying to track you, the app will never bother you. \n\n<h2><b>How does it work?</h2></b>\n\nAirGuard uses Bluetooth scans of your Android phone to find AirTags and Find My trackers. Every tracker that is found will be saved locally on your device. \nWhenever a tracker gets detected multiple times the app will recognize this. It compares the locations where the tracker has been detected. \nIf a tracker is detected at least 3 times and the locations have changed (to make sure its not your neighbour) the app sends you a notification. \nIf this tracker is an AirTag you can play a sound to find it. \n\nAll this happens locally on your device and the private information, like location, tracker ids, etc will never leave your device. \n\n<h2><b>Who are we?</h2></b>\nWe are part of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.

The Welefon source code contains an example App that uses the API in the folder apidemoapp.\n\nUsing this API, other Apps can receive details about the current calls. Like the deprecated PhoneStateListener of Android, this contains the phone number. In contrast to the PhoneStateListener, you do not need to fear the removal of the API. Additionally, Welefon includes details of calls in the background, e.g. calls that are in the state \"hold\".\n\nWelefon can receive additional caller details from other Apps. This can be a caller name, a caller details action and a RemoteView. The received caller name is shown as you expect it, completly independent of the system contact list. If a detail action is provided, then you can tap on the name to jump directly to the right place in the other App.\n\nThe RemoteViews are the method that allows Widgets on your homescreen. The same method can be used to show additional details and controls in the call screen. This allows showing any extra details.\n\nOf course this is safe and secure: The Welefon API can only be used with your permission.\n",

To add a new workout, tap on the \"+\" button on the bottom right corner and select \"Create\" to build it from scratch or \"Import\" to load a workout in JSON format. At the top-right corner of the home screen are two icons: a calendar with a checkmark in it (tapping this will go to the Log Screen) and a gear (tapping this will go to the Settings Screen).\n\n<b>Workout Screen</b>\nWhen a workout is running there is a progress bar at the top showing the current point in the workout, with the time elapsed on the left and the time remaining (indicated with a \"-\") on the right. In between these two times are a series of dots that represent the exercises in the workout, with the current exercise highlighted in blue. Below this is the name of the current exercise. During the exercise preparation time the name will have \"Get ready for\" before it (tapping on this will skip the preparation and begin the exercise). Below the exercise name is a stopwatch showing the current progress in that exercise, with the remaining time in the middle. Tapping on the stopwatch will pause the workout (indicated by blinking time inside the stopwatch), and tapping again will resume it. At the bottom of the screen is the name of the next exercise. Tapping on this will skip to the next exercise.\n\n<b>Edit screen</b>\nLists all exercises in a workout, with the preparation time on the left and the duration on the right. To change an exercise, tap on it and the two times will become spinners that can be swiped up or down to modify the time. Long-pressing on the spinner allows modifying the number with the keyboard (must be a number of seconds without any punctuation). Tapping on the exercise name will bring up the keyboard to edit it. Under the name are three icons: an up arrow to move the exercise higher in the list, a down arrow to move it lower, and a trash can to delete the it. In the top-right corner of the screen are two icons: a download icon to save the workout in JSON format to the Downloads folder, and a trash can to delete the entire workout.\n\n<b>Log Screen</b>\nLists all the executions of workouts, with the date and time on the left and the name of the workout on the right. At the top-right corner of the screen is a download icon that will save this list in JSON format to the Downloads folder.\n\n<b>Settings Screen</b>\nThis screen has three dropdown menus to select the sound to play for the last 3 seconds of preparation/exercise time, at the start and end of each exercise, and at the end of the workout. There are 4 options for each: nothing, a beep, a ding, or an applause.",

Will be used to transfer files if both parties are behind a firewall (NAT).\n* XEP-0163: Personal Eventing Protocol for avatars\n* XEP-0191: Blocking command lets you blacklist spammers or block contacts without removing them from your roster.\n* XEP-0198: Stream Management allows XMPP to survive small network outages and changes of the underlying TCP connection.\n* XEP-0280: Message Carbons which automatically syncs the messages you send to your desktop client and thus allows you to switch seamlessly from your mobile client to your desktop client and back within one conversation.\n* XEP-0237: Roster Versioning mainly to save bandwidth on poor mobile connections\n* XEP-0313: Message Archive Management synchronize message history with the server. Catch up with messages that were sent while Conversations was offline.\n* XEP-0352: Client State Indication lets the server know whether or not Conversations is in the background.

You put one by one\nthe random cards, that the dealer randomly deals from the deck, to one\nof the different Houses (it is of no importance the cards to be of the\nsame suit with the House), trying to achieve a total of 31 in the house.\nThe total is calculated adding the cards (Ace counts for 11, Kings,\nQueens, Jacks for 10 and the rest as they are, i.e. the 8 of Spades\ncounts for 8). Every time you manage to achieve a 31 in one of the\nhouses you get a bonus regarding the House in which you achieved that\n(10 for Spades, 20 for Clubs, 30 for Diamonds, 40 for Hearts) and the\nHouse becomes empty (total = 0). If in one of the Houses the total will\nexceed 31 then this House is closed and you cannot use it any more adding\ncards to it. In order to win you should add all 52 cards in the Houses\nand only then your score counts in the hall of fame. You lose if all the\nfour Houses will be closed.\n\nIf the number of cards in a House will be six (6) and the total is less\nthan 31, it counts as a 31, the player gets 50 points and the House\nbecomes empty.\n\nThis rule adds 4 Jokers to the deck (each with a different suit). If\nyou add it to the House “coloured” with the same suit (e.g. the Heart\nspecial card to the Heart House) then it is like having 31 no matter\nwhat was the total there and the player gets 100 points, but if you\nadd it to a House “coloured” with another suit (e.g. the Heart card\nto the Diamond House) you lose immediately.",

For example, imagine you are entering a large field and it's not clear where the exit is. Hikar will overlay the course of the footpath on your phone's camera feed helping you to navigate across the field. Or, you're at a junction of paths and it's not clear which is the correct way. Hikar will show a virtual signpost, showing the direction and distance of nearby points of interest such as villages, hills, mountains or pubs. Or, you're having to make your way across a pathless moor. Again, Hikar will help you find the way.\n\nHikar covers the whole of Europe, plus Turkey. It could potentially work in any area which uses Roman, Greek or Cyrillic characters, but the Hikar server (also FLOSS software: see gitlab.com/nickw1/freemap-api) currently only contains data for the specified areas.\nNote that Hikar is a research project and therefore, while perfectly usable for navigation it is not a 'polished' app with a really nice UI and, like many AR apps, can use a lot of battery power.\n\nPlease note, that for a currently-unknown reason, Hikar will not run on the Amazon Fire HD 10 (and possibly other Amazon Fire devices).\n\nMany thanks to my colleague Neil Brewis for providing the signpost assets.\n",

For statistics you can save your data locally on SD-Card.\n\nPlease note: Pressure sensor is mandatory. Steps will not be counted during walking, if there is a step sensor but no pressure sensor. \nElevation gain should only be counted if footsteps are detected, so only stairs and hill climbing will count, but not elevators or lifts. Don’t expect high accuracy - due to the concept of the sensors the accuracy is limited. And: avoid walking in trains or subways with active measurement, as the pressure (and therefore height) can change significantly during driving. \n\nYou can save regular and daily statistics automatically on SD-Card and save current values with the floating action button. Starting with Android 10 files are not saved to root-folder of SD-card anymore, but in app-directory. There isn’t much on graphical display of statistic data besides two progress bars. Just use any program which can read csv-values. \n\n<b>Permissions:</b>\n* Access to physical activity: Access to step sensor needs permission to access physical activity since Android 10+. The app will not work without this permission on devices with Android 10 and higher.\n* Keep device awake: Device will not be kept awake all time. It will be woken up regulary and kept awake if necessary for short time to ensure proper counting of steps and elevation gain.\n* Write to external storage: App will work without this permission, but you cannot save statistical values or markers.\n\n",

    "description": "Ripple is a \"panic button\" that can send it's trigger message to any app that is\na \"panic responder\". Such apps can do things like lock, disguise themselves,\ndelete private data, send an emergency message, and more. It is meant for\nsituations where there is time to react, but where users need to be sure it is\nnot mistakenly set off.\n\nHere are two example scenarios:\n\n* An organization gets regularly raided by the security forces, who search all of the computers and mobile devices on the premises. The organization usually has at least a minute or two of warning before a raid starts. They need a very reliable way to trigger wiping all of the data from the sensitive apps.\n* An aid worker has lots of sensitive data about people on their device. They regularly sync that data up with a secure, central database. Occasionally, the aid worker has to leave the country on very short notice. The border guards regularly download the entire contents of mobile devices of people crossing through. While waiting in line at the border, the aid worker sees the border guards seizing people's devices, and then remembers all the data on the device, so she unlocks her phone and hits the wipe trigger, which wipes all sensitive apps from the device. When the aid worker returns to the central office, the device is again synced up with the central database.",

A keymap can have a set of \"constraints\" so it only has an effect in certain situations.\n\nWhat can’t be remapped?\n * Power button\n * Bixby button\n * Mouse buttons\n * Dpad, thumb sticks or triggers on game controllers\n\nYour key maps don't work if the screen is OFF. This is a limitation in Android. There is nothing the dev can do.\n\nWhat can I remap my keys to do?\nSome actions will only work on rooted devices and specific Android versions.\n\nThere are too many features to list here so check out the full list here: https://docs.keymapper.club/user-guide/actions\n\nPermissions\nYou don't have to grant all the permissions for the app to work. The app will tell you if a permission needs to be granted for a feature to work.\n\n * Accessibility Service: Basic requirement for remapping to work. It is needed so the app can listen to and block keyevents.\n * Device Admin: To turn the screen off when using the action to turn off the screen.\n * Modify System Settings: To change the brightness and rotation settings.\n * Camera: To control the flashlight.\n\n On some devices, enabling the accessibility service will disable \"enhanced data encryption\".\n\nDiscord: www.keymapper.club\nWebsite: docs.keymapper.club",

    "description": "Use cases:\n\n- Attest the state of a Linux computer\n\nWhen your computer is in a trustworthy state, you can generate a private key hidden in the TPM2 of your computer. This private key can be sealed with the current state of the computer (PCRs). Then the computer can only sign a message with this key when it is in the correct state according to the PCRs. For example, you can seal the key against the secure boot state (PCR7). If your computer is booting an operating system signed by another vendor, the TPM2 cannot unseal the private key. So if your computer can generate a correct signature, it is in this known state. You can create a sealed private key and create such a signature with cryptographic-id-rs (https://gitlab.com/cryptographic_id/cryptographic-id-rs). This is similar to tpm2-totp (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-totp) but uses asymmetric cryptography. This means you do not need to keep the verification code secure. You can share it safely with the world.\n\n- Verify the identity of a phone\n\nYou can generate a private key when your phone is in a trustworthy state. If your phone can create a correct signature, you know it is the same phone. Since the operating system can access the private key, the security guarantees are much weaker than with a TPM2. So the verification is just as secure as your phone. If you use Graphene OS, also have a look at Auditor (https://attestation.app/tutorial).\n\n- Verify that a person is in possession of a private key\n\nThis works as well as the section above but has the same shortcomings. It can be used to verify someone in person when he sends his public key to you in advance over a secure channel.\n",

    "description": "Unstoppable wallet is purposely built as a decentralized management tool for cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt is engineered to serve privacy-conscious individuals looking to manage and invest in cryptocurrencies in a sovereign and professional manner.\n\nUnstoppable is built with the following in mind:\n\n- Capital Should Be Free >> It’s built to provide users with genuinely independent control over their capital.\n\n- Capital Should Be Borderless >> It works outside the traditional finance layer and acts as a Swiss knife to the world of decentralized finances (DeFi).\n\n- Capital Should Be Private >> It doesn’t leak private data, it has no means to track users, and takes extra measures to ensure privacy on multiple layers.\n\nIf the above rhymes well with you then Unstoppable is for you! And we are here to focus on your unique needs and serve you in the best possible manner.\n\nIf you're merely looking for a plain way to store Bitcoin or Ethereum this app might not be for you.\n\nWALLET FEATURES:\n\n- Non-Custodial Multi-wallet >> Manage any number of cryptocurrencies across multiple portfolio-style wallets in a non-custodial manner. This wallet is like your own bank where you are the only client and the only one in charge. It’s designed to keep assets secure and easy to restore even if the phone is stolen and tampered with.\n\n- Investment Oriented Wallet >> Unstoppable brings unmatched cryptocurrency market analytics to your device: advanced sorting, curated categorization, extensive search filtering, and event-based alerting features.\n\n- Universal Wallet >> It supports all mainstream blockchains and is built in a standard compliant manner enabling users to use just one wallet app for everything crypto.\n\n- A Bitcoin Wallet >> The wallet packs some of the most advanced Bitcoin features available: SPV enabled, BIP 44/49/84/69 compliant, Bitcoin timelocks, custom transaction fees, and more.\n\n- A DeFi Wallet >> Full support for decentralized token swaps on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, and more. Also, the ability to interact with any smart contract-powered service on the blockchain via the WalletConnect protocol.\n\n- Ethereum Wallet >> Full support for Ethereum blockchain, its growing ecosystem of tokens (ERC20, NFT tokens, etc.), and other decentralized services such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service).\n\n- Ethereum L2 Wallet >> Artbitrum, Optimism, Polygon support.\n\n- Avalanche Wallet >> Full support for Avalanche C-Chain blockchain.\n\n- Binance Wallet >> Full support for original Binance Chain (incl. BEP2) and Binance Smart Chain.\n\n- NFT Wallet >> Full support for Non Fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n- Crypto Academy >> The app includes two courses meant to onboard newcomers into the world of cryptocurrencies and the DeFi ecosystem in an easy-to-digest manner covering essential aspects of cryptocurrency security, storage, privacy, transacting, and exchanging.\n\n- Wallet for Privacy Coins >> Fully supports major privacy coins (ZCash, DASH) in an SPV manner. One of the very few wallets capable of supporting fully shielded Zcash transactions as well as the ability to privatize Bitcoin transactions.\n\n- Decentralized Wallet >> Designed to work with most major blockchains in a decentralized manner where an app doesn't depend on some server of a wallet provider to send/receive transactions but interacts with blockchain networks directly.\n\n- Privacy Focused >> Designed to allow for privacy even in the most privacy-breaching scenarios. There are no user accounts keeping your records, no identity checks that risk exposing your financials to the world, and no interaction with traditional finance layers. The app is partially TOR enabled and VPN support is coming soon.\n\n- Fully Open Source >> The most transparent wallet application built to date. The entire 4-year production process of the app is openly accessible online along with 100% of its code for anyone to evaluate or reuse in other projects. Verified and audited by third parties.\n\nBe Unstoppable!  😎",

    "description": "<b>Oversec transparently encrypts and decrypts any text in any app</b>\n\nYou can use it to exchange private encrypted and covert chat- or email messages or store your own encrypted notes on your phone.\n\nSee our demo videos:\n* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZ9dA5ELXE\">Introduction</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ_-5X2tiAo\">Encrypting Emails</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laq7SGwiuAw\">Encrypting Images</a>\n\nOversec is completely agnostic of the subjacent app, it works with Whatsapp™, Line™, Snapchat™, Instagram™ or any other chat app. It also supports sending and receiving PGP encrypted messages with the Gmail™  or any other Email app.\n\nEnd-to-End Encryption was yesterday. Oversec introduces \"Eye-to-Eye\" encryption. <b>Encrypted data is only decrypted while it is shown on the screen!</b> No clear text is ever persisted and thus cannot be extracted from the file system or accidentally be backed up into the cloud.\n\nWe also carefully designed Oversec so that it doesn't require internet access. Because of that, you can rest assured that no decrypted information can ever leave your device.\n\n<u>How it works:</u>\n\nOversec constantly monitors the text on your screen. When it finds an encrypted text, it tries to decrypt it and then shows the decrypted text as an overlay in place of the encrypted text. Conversely, it can read text out of an input field, encrypt it, and then put the encrypted text back into the input field.\n\nIn order to encrypt a text, Oversec shows a button next to an active input field. After having entered the secret text, tapping that button makes Oversec read the text, encrypt it and put back the encrypted text into the field. It is now ready to be sent in the subjacent app as usual - the app doesn't even know that it is sending encrypted data!\n\nOversec also features a unique way of encoding the encrypted messages. It stores the encrypted text in invisible (zero-width) characters and let's you add decoy text at the end. That way, a message will just show e.g. \"The sun is shining!\" with no visible sign of any encryption, whereas in reality it contains a hidden encrypted message.\n\nYou may also encrypt and send photos through Oversec - its unique camera mode even allows you to take and send an encrypted photo without ever storing the original photo on the device.\n\nOversec encrypts your data either using symmetric keys (using ChaCha20 cipher + Poly1305 MAC ) or using asymmetric PGP encryption (making use of the <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/\">OpenKeychain</a> app).\n\nThe code is open source and can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/oversecio/oversec\">here</a>.\n\nThis app uses Accessibility services.\n",

Note that no conclusion can be drawn from an individual result of the type \"Differentiation detected\" to characterize a breach of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 on Open Internet.\n\nAs net neutrality regulations vary according to location, Wehe collects coarse-grained geolocation data (with a precision of 0.1 degrees latitude/longitude) if users explicitly opt in to providing it.

The deidentified data are published as open data to let third parties reproduce the conclusions of the tests carried out.

When you get to the Duo login screen, choose `Add a new device` and authenticate if needed.\n3. Choose to activate a `Tablet`, then choose `Android`.\n4. Click `I have Duo Mobile installed`, then `Take me to Duo Mobile`.\n5. Your OTP app should then open, asking to confirm importing the secret token. If an error occurs, DuOTP will pop up an error message. If nothing happens, then DuOTP is not installed correctly, or your browser is not activating it.\n6. After you have saved the account in your OTP app, return to the browser. Tap `Continue` and `Continue to Login`. Now and any future time you are prompted by the Duo login screen, choose `Enter a Passcode` and copy the numeric code from your OTP app.\n\nAfter this, you don't need to use DuOTP again, and may remove it from your device if you'd like.

Some of the following features are\nnot supported yet.\n\nText messages are not only end-to-end encrypted, they also get stored on your\ndevice in an encrypted way. Images, attachments etc. can be sent -- encrypted,\nof course, but since they depend on third-party programs, they are stored\nunencrypted. Dib2Qm makes use of your device's 'Download' folder (also for\nbackups and archives).\n\nYou need an e-mail account (on a server with standard IMAP and SMTP services),\nfor which a small app like this one is allowed to access the services.\n\nJust try it out! -- on a non-critical device (And if your e-mail provider blocks\nit, use a different provider. Dib2Qm does not depend on a centralized server.)\n\n- You can only chat with people who also use Dib2Qm.\n- After the setup, please first start the messaging service (via menu).\n- If you get a connection, the status should turn green (... 'ON').\n- Add a contact, via menu: you have to enter the other one's e-mail address.\n- If you then touch the new contact, you will be asked to send the 'invitation'\n(i.e. the key info for exchanging secured messages).\n- Once the key exchange is completely done (black/red, orange, green), the chat\nworks similar to other apps.\n\nIf one of your chats gets 'stuck' (due to a key exchange problem), just send\nanother 'invitation' from within the chat.\n\nIt is possible to use the address of your device's 'Google account', but they\ninsist on you explicitly allowing messenger apps: you would log in with your\nbrowser (!), go to 'Settings', 'Forwarding...IMAP', 'Enable IMAP', 'Save', then\nto 'Accounts', 'Other ... settings', '...Security', '2-Step...', 'Off', and\n'Connected apps', 'Allow less secure', 'On'.\n\nStrange? It is easier to use an extra e-mail account for Dib2Qm, but depending\non your provider you might still have to allow IMAP services. Both, using the\ndevice's account address or using a dedicated e-mail address for Dib2Qm, have\ntheir advantages and disadvantages ...\n\nIf you want to do a complete re-start, go to the device's settings, clear the\napp data, then open a file manager, clear the 'Download/dibdib' data, and then\nyou can start the app a-fresh.\n",

The app will then try to predict following numbers from the generator.\n\nThe app expects all numbers to be entered as integers or floating point numbers between zero and one.  Currently, floating point numbers are supported for the Mersenne Twister only.  Three input modes are supported:\n1. <em>Text field</em> lets you enter the numbers directly on the device.\n2. <em>File</em> lets you choose a file with newline separated number strings.\n3. <em>Socket</em> opens a server socket on the device.  You can then connect with a custom client by means of a client socket and send newline separated number strings to the server.  After each number the server will send back the next newline separated predictions.  Each block of predictions is separated by an additional newline.\n\nTo test the app, enter the following numbers in the <em>Text field</em>:\n<code>\n1412437139\n1552322984\n168467398\n1111755060\n-928874005\n</code>\n\nThese numbers were sampled from the Java linear congruential generator <em>Random.nextInt()</em>.  Thus, the app should detect <em>LCG: Java</em> after the third number input, and numbers in the prediction history should appear in green instead of red, indicating that those numbers were correctly predicted.\n\nThe source code of this app is published on GitLab.  There you can also find a Python program for testing socket input: https://gitlab.com/asnelt/derandom/blob/HEAD/README.md\n",

    "description": "Note: We now support the B2100 series of G-Shock watches!\n\nI think we can do better than the official G-Shock Connected App! This app provides the following extra features:\n\n- Sets watch's reminders from Google Calendar\n- Automatically sets correct timezone when travelling. No need to switch between Word Time and Home time\n- Use your watch to trigger actions on your phone remotely, like taking pictures, dialling a phone number, etc.\n- Auto-configure most watch settings from phone's configuration.\n- Phone's alarms can be synced with watch's alarms.\n- Super fast connection time: 3.5 seconds vs 12 seconds for the official app.\n\nThe supported watches B5000, B5600 and B2100 series:\n\nhttps://amzn.to/3Mt68Qb\nhttps://amzn.to/4194M13\nhttps://amzn.to/3MUDCGY\n\nGeneral\n=======\nThe app works by sending commands to the watch via Bluetooth (BLE). The watch \ndata is not persisted on the phone, but instead is read from the watch each \ntime a connection is established. Any changes on the app are sent back to the \nwatch, only when the Send to Watch button is pressed.\n\nSetting Time\n============\nThe local time can be set from the main screen by pressing the Send to Watch \nbutton next to the current time display. The app uses your current location to \nget the local lime. You can then set the watch time accordingly, without having \nto change your World Time selection on the watch.\n\nThis screen also shows your Home Time location and battery level.\n\nAlarms\n======\nThe B5600/B5000/B2100 watches have 5 alarms and a Signal or chime setting. They are first read\nfrom the watch, and displayed in the app. The alarms can be updated by pressing \non the time display of each alarm. A dialog will appear which allows you to \nselect the time.\n\nOnce the alarms have been set, you can send them to the watch, or send them to \nthe Alarm Clock app on the phone. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to \nread the alarms from the AlarmClock app programmatically, so we cannot set the \nwatch alarms from this app. However, we can set the Alarm Clock app with the \nwatch's alarms.\n\nEvents\n======\nMake sure you have set your phone to auto-sync to your google account. \nOtherwise, adding events in your phone will not be reflected to the Google \naccount, and you will not be able to see the events in the app.\n\nThis screen displays Events from your Google Calendar and allows you to send \nthese events to the watch's reminders. (don't confuse these with reminders in \nthe Google Calendar app. These reminders are special features and are not\naccessible programmatically).\n\nThere are many ways to set calendar events in Google Calendar. Events could be \none time, repeating daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or some complex period \nsuch as every second Thursday of the month. There are also events which occur \nnumber of times only (count events), like repeat this event 12 times every \nMonday. Not all event types can be supported on the watch, but this app \nattempts to adopt the calendar events to the watch as much as possible. The \nonly not supported event types are daily and complex events, such as every\nsecond Thursday of the month. Count events are simulated on the watch with\na start and end date, matching the event start time, count and frequency.\nIn case the calendar event cannot be adopted to a watch reminder, the app\nwill display the event as Incompatible. Only future events and recurring\nevents which have not expired are displayed.\n\nThe watch only supports all-day reminders. However, if the Google calendar \nevent has a specific time, it will still be used as a day reminder on the watch.\n\nActions\n=======\nThe selected actions are run when the user short-presses the lower-right watch \nbutton from disconnected mode (initial screen).\n\nUsing these actions, the watch acts like a remote control for your phone.\n\nBuild Your Own App\n==================\nFor those who want to build their own Android app for interfacing with the G-Shock 5000/5600/B2100 watches,\nI have also created an API (library) pr",

We call this the Cloud version. But for most translation team members, it will be better to install Bibledit locally. This is called the Client version. The Client version saves editing changes made by each team member to his/her device, and when they have an connection, their work will automatically be saved to the Cloud.</li>\n<li>Many excellent and scholarly translation resources available in Bibledit. And one can view translation resources while editing a translation on the same screen.</li>\n<li>Bibledit can port changes in a Bible text over to a local instance of Paratext. I think many translation team leaders will want to do this. But the opposite is also possible: Bibledit can receive Bible texts from Paratext.</li>\n<li>Bibledit has many powerful export options. These include creating web-ready HTML files, beautifully formatted OpenOffice files (which then can easily be turned into PDF files), and Sword modules for Bible-reading applications on all smart devices.</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "<b>Description</b>\n\nBluePass extracts two factor authentication codes (2FA) from SMS and sends them to a paired device via Bluetooth RFCOMM. A Qt based companion app <a href=\"https://github.com/boon-code/bluepass-server\">bluepass-server</a> will receive the 2FA codes and provide them via the system clipboard.\n\n\n<b>Use Case</b>\n\nThe company I work for is relying on third party services that require to authenticate using 2FA. The second factor is an SMS to your mobile phone. This app was built for convenience, to avoid having to unlock your phone, find the message and then type the received code on the PC.\n\nIt is not about the time saved, it's about getting rid of robot tasks.\n\n\n<b>Setup</b>\n\nYou have to configure parameters to match the sender of the SMS and parse the code from the messages sent to you. Currently, regular expressions are used for this task. However, a very basic setup will be provided below.\n\n<i>Regular expression for sender</i> has to be set to a regular expression that matches all the senders of SMS (as they appear in your chat application). Multiple numbers and names can be provided:\n<ul>\n    <li>To match <i>CompanyA</i>, you might simply put<i>CompanyA</i> into the box</li>\n    <li>To match <i>CompanyA</i> and <i>12345678</i>, write <i>(CompanyA|12345678)</i></li>\n</ul>\n\n<i>Regular expression to filter the content</i> has to be set to a regular expression that matches the messages you want to catch. Additionally, it has to define one group to extract the actual code that has to be sent to the PC.\n<ul>\n    <li>To match any number, you can use <i>[^\\d]*(\\d+).*</i></li>\n    <li>To match a code only with 6 digits, use: <i>.*(\\d{6}).*</i></li>\n</ul>\n\n... as the process of defining a proper regular expression is not that easy, there is another text box <i>Test message</i>. You can paste here the content of the SMS thatyou want to match and adjust the regular expression until it gets parsed correctly.\n\nThe last step of the configuration is to pair with the bluetooth adapter of your PC and configure the adapter to be used.\n\n\n<b>Operation</b>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Whenever your mobile phone receives an SMS (and the settings above are configured), this app will try to match the sender and content. If one of the two doesn't match, the message will not be processed any further.</li>\n    <li>If the 2FA code could be extracted, a foreground service will be started (status bar) and the app tries to connect to the configured Bluetooth adapter and sends the code. It retries for some amount of time and reports the status in the status bar. <u>Note</u>: The notification in the status bar doesn't automatically disappear. However, this doesn't consume any resources and can be removed using the <i>Stop</i> button.</li>\n    <li> If the code is required on the mobile phone, it can be copied using the <i>Copy last</i> button.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<b>Protocol</b>\n\nThe communication is based on very simple primitives using an RFCOMM channel. The UUID for the service is <i>e4d56fb3-b86d-4572-9b0d-44d483eb1eee</i>. Extracted codes are sent as text (over a secure Bluetooth connection) terminated with a new line character. Therefore, codes may not contain any new line characters.\n\n\n<b>Future</b>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>The protocol will be changed to something more sophisticated and extensible</li>\n    <li>Configuration of the sender should be done through contact providers and not use regular expressions</li>\n    <li>Allow to use this app to share text / files with the PC</li>\n</ul>\n",

All DNS requests are anonymously handled by Calyx when the VPN is on.\n* Circumvention: When \"Use Bridges\" option is enabled, all your traffic is hidden as normal web traffic, in order to circumvent some censorship systems that block VPN traffic.\n\nAs with all VPNs, CalyxVPN only adds security to your data as it flows over the network. It cannot protect the content of your data that is stored or that you give to a website. It also does not prevent advertising and tracking in your apps or web browser (except when this tracking is based on your IP address).",

That’s why we’re excited about creating usable voice technology for our machines. But to create voice systems, developers need an extremely large amount of voice data.\nMost of the data used by large companies isn’t available to the majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we’ve launched Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open and accessible to everyone.\nNow you can donate your voice to help us build an open-source voice database that anyone can use to make innovative apps for devices and the web. Read a sentence to help machines learn how real people speak. Check the work of other contributors to improve the quality. It’s that simple!\nYou can find more details on the official website <a href=\"https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/\">https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Why should you use the app instead of the website on mobile?</b>\n\nThe app is developed specifically for smartphones so it's native. It has many features that website don't provide you, such as dark theme, offline mode, customisation, gestures, etc.\nThe app is lighter than website, without annoying animations (and animations in the app can also be stopped in Settings).\nIn addition, the website has many bugs, especially for mobile-version, so you cannot do everything correctly.\n</p>",

HIIT comprises a sequence of alternating rest (warm\nup/cool down) intervals and work blocks. For example, a workout with two workout\nblocks will look like\n\n1) warm up 2) block #1 3) rest 4) block #2 5)cool down\n\nBats! HIIT always inserts rest intervals between blocks, and always includes a\nwarm up and cool down interval.\n\nThe length of the rest interval is configurable. By default, it is 60 seconds.\n\n<b>Block structure</b>\n\nA block is a series of work/break interval pairs; each work interval has a\ncorresponding break interval. For example, you might configure Bats! HIIT to\ninclude 4 work intervals per block, with a 50 second work interval and 10 second\nbreak. Such a block would take 4 minutes.\n\n<b>Audio and visual cues</b>\n\nBats! HIIT always gives a warning consisting of 4 short chirps when you're about\nto transition to a new interval. Every work interval begins with a single\nhigh-pitched beep; break intervals begin with a descending, two-tone beep. Rest\nintervals do not have an initial beep.\n\nDuring work intervals, your phone's screen will be green. In breaks, the screen\nwill turn yellow. Rest is indicated by a red background. Your phone will also\ntell you how long is left in the present sub-interval and how many work/break\npairs and blocks remain.\n\n<b>Screen lock</b>\n\nWhen you're exercising, you want to be able to see your progress without\nunlocking your screen. Bats! HIIT prevents your screen from turning off, though\nit does allow it to dim for power savings. This lets you know at a glance how\nyou're doing. Save/recall workout\n\nYou can save/recall/delete stored workouts. \"Last workout\" is automatically\ncreated whenever you do a workout, and is restored when the app is next started.\n\n<b>Pause workout</b>\n\nIf Bats! HIIT loses focus during a workout, your workout will be paused and will\nresume when Bats! HIIT resumes. Delay locked loop\n\nTo ensure that your workout is accurately timed, Bats! HIIT implements a\nfeedback system called a delay-locked loop. Every second, when Bats! HIIT wakes\nup to update the timer readout, it measures how long it was actually asleep and\nadjusts future delay intervals to hit the target 1-second sleep interval. In\npractice, this reduces short-term timing errors from more than 5% to about 0.2%;\nsince the error is integrated over the life of your workout, the overall\naccuracy is two to three orders of magnitude better than the short-term errors.",

Reporting and collecting trash allow users to <b>earn points</b>, and require access to the phone's <i>location</i> in order to determine the object's position.\n\nInformative <i><b>pills</b></i> will be shown each time the app is launched, with FAQs, news, and tips regarding ecology and environment protection.\n\nInsigno is completely <b>Free Software</b>, you can find the code here:\n- Frontend (app): https://github.com/MindsHub/insigno_frontend\n- Backend (server): https://github.com/MindsHub/insigno_backend",

Also, as RoadEagle needs to convert the data from different formats to TraFF, it may not be able to represent all traffic messages as intended by their creators.\n\nThis app receives requests from compatible apps (consumers) which may expose the device location (and, possibly, where you intend to travel). Because of the location information, consumer apps may refuse to send such requests to apps without location permission. This is the only thing RoadEagle uses this permission for; it will never request a location update. \n\nPhoto by Joanna Pędzich-Opioła | CC_BY 2.0\n",

G. (1981). Uses and abuses of hearing loss classification. Asha, 23, 493–500.)\n\nDegree of hearing loss:  dB HL range\nNormal: –10 to 15\nSlight: 16 to 25\nMild:   26 to 40\nModerate:   41 to 55\nModerately severe:  56 to 70\nSevere: 71 to 90\nProfound:   91+\n\nFirst your earphones must be calibrated. You can either perform a full test which requires one or better several persons between the ages of 18 and 35 with normal hearing. Or you can perform a simple calibration at 1000Hz only (assuming good hearing at this frequency). In this case it is assumed that the earphones are linear across the frequency range and calibration values for the other frequencies are then calculated using the ISO226:2003 standard. Whenever you hear a beep simply touch the screen.  You can pause / continue with a long click and speed up with a double click. If you have several persons available for calibration simply press \"Add Calibration\" and an average value of existing calibrations will be calculated. You may also delete the whole calibration.\n\nAfter that you can perform tests and view them in test results.\n\nYou can then also perform tests at single frequencies. There you can manually select ear, frequency, and sound amplitude by clicking on the buttons.\n\nRequired permissions:\n - Microphone\n - External storage for backup/restore\n\nNo ads, no trackers.\n",

    "description": "This app can track your work time easily! You can automate time tracking using geo-fencing functions (see below). You may also categorize each recorded interval by a predefined client/task and a free text. Of course, the list of clients/tasks can be edited to suit your needs, and the app has a widget for your home screen.\n\nAdditionally, if you wish, your flexible time account is taken care of: you always see how much you worked. You can also keep an eye on how much work time is left for today or for the current week (by a notification which you can enable).\n\nThe app enables you to modify the planned working time effortlessly - just tap on the date you want to edit in the main table.\n\nYou may provide the geo-coordinates of your work place and the app can automatically clock you in while you are at work. This is done without using GPS, so your battery won't be emptied by this app.\n\nYou also may provide a Wi-Fi network name which is visible at your work place the app can use to clock in automatically when this SSID is in range (you don't need to be connected to this network). Of course you should have Wi-Fi enabled for this to work.\n\nYou don't want to open the app for clocking in and out? No problem - there are at least three ways to do that: add the widget to your home screen, use launcher shortcuts (long press the app icon for that) or add a new quick settings tile to your panel by tapping on the pencil below and dragging the \"Track Work Time\" tile up which then can toggle your clocked-in state.\n\nIf you prefer to use other apps like LlamaLab Automate or Tasker for tracking your movements, that's fine - TWT can be triggered from other apps and just do the book-keeping of your work time. In this case, you have to create broadcast intents called org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockIn or org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockOut. When using ClockIn, you can also set the parameters task=... and text=... in the \"extra\" section of the intent so your events are more meaningful. You can also use the action org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.StatusRequest to get the current state of TWT: is the user clocked in, and if so, with which task and how much time remains for today? For more details on this, see the web site.\n\nIt's also possible the other way around: TWT generates broadcast intents on event creation/update/deletion. Automation apps can listen for the actions org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.event.Created, org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.event.Updated and org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.event.Deleted. See the web site for more details and some screenshots on how to use it.\n\nIf you have a Pebble smart watch, the app will notify you on clock-in and clock-out events which is especially useful if you want to be in the know about automatic time tracking via location and/or WiFi.\n\nFor other smart watches you can enable some options regarding notifications to help you. Firstly, you can enable the notification generally. Without any other related option, this will only display a notification on your phone in case you're clocked in. To also display this notification on your phone when not clocked in, select to always show it. Now, if you want it also on your watch, you also have to switch notifications to non-persistent (otherwise Android won't synchronize them). This is kind of a compromise because with this option notifications won't be pinned at the top of the list and also can be closed unintentionally (but will be displayed again after a minute). In addition you can silence all notifications so you are not distracted by them (this will be applied on your watch as well as on your phone, Android doesn't differentiate here).\n\nIf you want to back up your data, you have the choice: use Google's mechanism or do it on your own. To use Google's servers just enable the corresponding option. And if you don't want to give your data to Google: The app automatically creates a backup each day which is written to the directory you allowed for the app (if you didn't allow",

    "description": "The main function of Finder is to send the location of the smartphone it's installed on when requested. It also has a \"tracker\" feature (it can’t be activated remotely, only manually). The application is designed to search for missing people or stolen phones. SMS is used for communication because Internet connectivity may be not available. The app has two ways of determining the coordinates: using GPS (gps must be enabled in system settings, or special permission granted via ADB for auto-enabling), and using mobile and WiFi network info.\n\n<b>Important!</b> On Android 6.0 and newer for the Wifi networks searching feature, GPS must be enabled beforehand! (or enable GPS auto activating). GPS will not be used during network scanning, but nevertheless, newer versions of Android require it to be turned on (otherwise the system returns an empty list of networks). The app has a detailed help section, read it before use (but it is best to check whether the app works on a real device before use).\n\nWhen location is retrieved using WiFi and mobile networks, the response SMS will have the MAC addresses of surrounding WiFi networks, and to determine the location it is necessary to have this application and a connection the Internet on the requesting phone (not needed on the remote [responding] side). This method can help in the case of trying to find a phone in a building / dense arrangement of buildings in the city.\n\nTime in the \"history\" section - the local time of the requesting phone at the moment the coordinates were determined by the responding phone (included in sms).\n\nAn important feature is the fact that the application only responds to numbers from the \"trusted list\" and only when the \"respond to requests\" option is enabled! It is necessary to add the telephone numbers from which the requests will be sent in advance. The commands on the requesting and responding phones must be the same. It is possible to enable remote adding of phone nimbers to the \"trusted list\". If this mode is enabled (and the command is right) it allows you to remotely register a previously unknown number in the \"trusted list\". Finder displays notifications for any requests/responses.\n\nIt is also possible to send your coordinates manually to any number from \"trusted list\".\n\nApp can ring by request from trusted numbers. It disable \"don't disturb mode\", set 90% volume and play ringtone. To stop ringtone click on the notification, or it stops automatically after time from settings. Volume remain on original value.\n\nMIUI users (and possibly some other OSes) need to apply additional system settings to make the application operate reliably. This is described in detail in the built-in help.\n\nIf the tracker function is  enabled, the device sends its coordinates to one of the trusted numbers with a set period. On the other device incoming SMS are parsed and a track is displayed on the map. Tracks can be exported in GPX format to be used in other navigation applications (the only difference from standard is local time instead UTC).\n\nPermissions are requested immediately at the start, because they will be needed later for determining the coordinates in the background. Description of required permissions:\n\n<i>Access to location</i> - obvious, for retrieving location.\n<i>Access to SMS</i> - \"receive\" - for detecting commands, \"read\" - needed in the case of the app not detecting having receivied SMS with network data, \"send\" - to send location and commands.\n<i>Write to external storage</i> - for cache of map and export track in gpx.\n*<i>Read phone state</i> - requested only for android 8.0 due to a bug in this version of the OS (only in 8.0).\n<i>WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</i>, <i>WRITE_SETTINGS</i> - needed for automatically activating GPS on device (app can work without this permission, but GPS should be enabled manually beforehand). Can be granted using an ADB command: \"adb shell pm grant ru.seva.finder android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS\", for more info see https://githu",

You must set the Default profile to undo all changes before uninstalling.\n\nFeatures:\n- Advertising to other apps that low power mode is enabled\n- Android's data saver for metered WiFi or mobile data connections\n- The built-in dark mode\n- Launch boost to accelerate app starts\n- Vibration\n- Showing window and activity animations\n- Allowing apps to use the SoundTrigger HAL\n- Deferring full device backups for later\n- Deferring app setting backups for later\n- Using the built-in web firewall to protect against possibly malicious sites\n- Changing the location access mode restrictions for apps\n- Reducing the max brightness of the panel\n- Forcing all apps into standby mode\n- Forcing all apps to not check data in the background\n- Disabling unnecessary sensors\n- Using the Always-On-Display\n- Putting the device into deep sleep as soon as the screen turns off\n\nIt also enables something called \"sticky\" low power mode.
